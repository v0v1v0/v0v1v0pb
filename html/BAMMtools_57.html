<h2>BAMMtools datasets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Example datasets and sample <code>BAMM</code> output for the
package <code>BAMMtools</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This includes both the raw data and the <code>BAMM</code> output for
three example analyses. The first is an analysis of speciation and
extinction rates during the radiation of modern whales, using a
time-calibrated tree from Steeman et al. (2009). The second is a
<code>BAMM</code> analysis of phenotypic evolutionary rates (body mass)
during the radiation of extant primates, taken from Vos and Mooers
(2006) and Redding et al. (2010).The third is a <code>BAMM</code> analysis
of speciation and extinction rates for a 300-species subset of
ray-finned fishes, along with body size data for these species from
Rabosky et al. (2013). 
</p>
<p>Dataset <code>whales</code> is the raw time-calibrated tree that was
analyzed with <code>BAMM</code>, <code>primates</code> is the corresponding
time-calibrated phylogeny of 233 primate species, and <code>fishes</code>
is the time-calibrated phylogeny of 300 fish species. Log-transformed
body masses for primates are in dataset <code>mass.primates</code>, and fish
body sizes are in dataset <code>traits.fishes</code>.
</p>
<p>The MCMC output files (<code>mcmc.whales</code> and <code>mcmc.primates</code>)
are dataframes containing the raw MCMC output as generated by
<code>BAMM</code>. Column headers in the dataframes includes the sampling
generation, the current number of shifts in the simulation
(<code>N_shifts</code>), the log-prior density of the parameters
(<code>logPrior</code>), the log-likelihood of the data (<code>logLik</code>), the
current parameter of the Poisson process governing the number of
regime shifts (<code>eventRate</code>), and the MCMC acceptance rate
(<code>acceptRate</code>). This is the file that would typically be analyzed
as a first step towards assessing MCMC convergence (e.g., analyzing
effective sample sizes of <code>logLik</code> and <code>N_shifts</code>).
</p>
<p>The "core" <code>BAMM</code> output is included in the <em>event data</em>
files (<code>events.whales</code>, <code>events.primates</code> and
<code>events.fishes</code>). These are all the parameters sampled with MCMC
that are relevant to reconstructing the nature and location of
evolutionary rate dynamics across a phylogeny. Please refer to
<code>BAMM</code> documentation for a detailed overview of this output, but
a brief description is as follows:
</p>
<p><code>generation</code>: The index value of the state in the MCMC simulation
(the "generation").
</p>
<p><code>leftchild, rightchild</code>: This defines a unique topological
location where a rate shift was sampled. Specifically, for given
right-left pair, the shift is sampled on the branch leading to the
node from which <code>rightchild</code> and <code>leftchild</code> are descended
(these two taxa are part of the spanning set of taxa for the node). If
<code>leftchild</code> is "NA", this simply means that the shift was sampled
on a terminal branch.
</p>
<p><code>abstime</code>: The absolute occurrence time of the shift, assuming
that the time of the root node is 0.0.
</p>
<p><code>lambdainit, lambdashift</code>: For speciation extinction model, the
initial speciation rate and rate change parameter for the process.
</p>
<p><code>muinit</code>: For speciation extinction model, the extinction rate
(time-invariant).
</p>
<p><code>betainit, betashift</code>: For phenotypic evolutionary model, the
initial (<code>betainit</code>) rate of phenotypic evolution and the rate
change parameter (<code>betashift</code>).
</p>
