<h2>Finalization of Objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Registers an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> function to be called upon garbage collection of
object or (optionally) at the end of an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> session.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  reg.finalizer(e, f, onexit = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code id="e">e</code></td>
<td>
<p>object to finalize.  Must be an environment or an external pointer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="f">f</code></td>
<td>
<p>function to call on finalization. Must accept a single argument,
which will be the object to finalize.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="onexit">onexit</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should the finalizer be run if the object is
still uncollected at the end of the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> session?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main purpose of this function is to allow objects that refer to
external items (a temporary file, say) to perform cleanup actions when
they are no longer referenced from within <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.  This only makes sense
for objects that are never copied on assignment, hence the restriction
to environments and external pointers.
</p>
<p><em>Inter alia</em>, it provides a way to program code to be run at
the end of an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> session without manipulating <code>.Last</code>.
For use in a package, it is often a good idea to set a finalizer on an
object in the namespace: then it will be called at the end of the
session, or soon after the namespace is unloaded if that is done
during the session.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>'s interpreter is not re-entrant and the finalizer could be run in
the middle of a computation.  So there are many functions which it is
potentially unsafe to call from <code>f</code>: one example which caused
trouble is <code>options</code>.  Finalizers are
scheduled at garbage collection but only run at a relatively safe time
thereafter.

memory management.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">f &lt;- function(e) print("cleaning....")
g &lt;- function(x){ e &lt;- environment(); reg.finalizer(e, f) }
g()
invisible(gc()) # trigger cleanup
</code></pre>
