<h2> 
Function that performs a functional enrichment analysis based on a one-sided Fisher's exact teset (hypergeometric test).
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

 
<p>For a given set of candidate genes, reference genes and a list object of gene sets (e.g. Gene Ontology terms or gene sets from pathways) a one-sided Fisher's exact test ("greater") is performed for each gene set in the collection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  
   enrichment(genes, reference, genesets, adj = "fdr", verbose = FALSE)  
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

 
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genes</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>A character vector of gene identifiers used as a candidate gene list that is assessed by the functional enrichment analysis. The candidate gene list is a subset of the reference gene list.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>A character vector of gene identifiers used as the reference gene list. Note all candidate genes are included in the reference gene list.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genesets</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>A named list object of a collection of gene sets. The identifiers used for the candidate and reference genes need to match the identifier types used for the gene sets. An example list of gene sets is given in data(exgensets) showing an example list object of gene sets from pathways with gene symbols.

<p>The default value is &lt;fdr&gt; (False discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach). 
Multiple testing correction based on the function stats::p.adjust() with available options for 
"holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr" and "none"

</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>The default value is &lt;FALSE&gt;. If this option is set &lt;TRUE&gt; the number and name of the 
gene sets during their processing is reported.

<h3>Details</h3>

 
<p>The enrichment analysis is based on a one-sided Fisher's exact test.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

 
<p>The function returns a data.frame object with the columns 
</p>
<p>"TermID" the given name of a gene set i from the named gene set collection list object S.
"genes"  the number of candidate genes present in the gene set i
"all"    the number of all genes present in the gene set i
"pval"   the nominal p-value from a one-sided fisher's exact test
"padj"   the adjusted p-value to consider for multiple testing
</p>
