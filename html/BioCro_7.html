<h2>Global annual mean atmopspheric CO2 levels</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Multiple years of globally averaged annual mean atmospheric CO2 levels and
their uncertainties.
</p>
<p>This data is included in the BioCro package so users can reproduce
calculations in Lochocki <em>et al.</em> (2022)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003">doi:10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003</a>] and for exploratory purposes; it is
likely that most BioCro studies will require different data sets, and no
attempt is made here to be exhaustive.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">catm_data</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with 3 columns and 44 rows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>year</code>: the year
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Catm</code>: CO2 concentration (micromol / mol)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>unc</code>: the uncertainty associated with the CO2 concentration
(micromol / mol)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Data were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Global Monitoring Laboratory (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html) on
2024-02-07.
</p>
<p>The exact link used was
https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_annmean_gl.txt.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the data can be accessed from
https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/gl_data.html by clicking the link to
<code>Globally averaged marine surface annual mean data (CSV)</code>.
</p>
<p>Note: the globally averaged value for 2023 was not yet available, so the
2023 Mauna Loa value was used instead as a temporary fix. This value is likely
to be slightly higher than the global value (by around 1 ppm).

<p>These data are provided here as a convenience to BioCro users; please visit
the NOAA GML webpage for guidelines regarding the use of this data if you are
intending to include it in a publication.
