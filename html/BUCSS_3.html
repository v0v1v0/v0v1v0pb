<h2>Necessary sample size to reach desired power for a one or two-way
between-subjects ANOVA using an uncertainty and publication bias correction
procedure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ss.power.ba</code> returns the necessary per-group sample size
to achieve a desired level of statistical power for a planned study testing
an omnibus effect using a one or two-way fully between-subjects ANOVA,
based on information obtained from a previous study. The effect from the
previous study can be corrected for publication bias and/or uncertainty to
provide a sample size that will achieve more accurate statistical power for
a planned study, when compared to approaches that use a sample effect size
at face value or rely on sample size only. The bias and uncertainty
adjusted previous study noncentrality parameter is also returned, which can
be transformed to various effect size metrics.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Researchers often use the sample effect size from a prior study as
an estimate of the likely size of an expected future effect in sample size
planning. However, sample effect size estimates should not usually be used
at face value to plan sample size, due to both publication bias and
uncertainty.
</p>
<p>The approach implemented in <code>ss.power.ba</code> uses the observed
<code class="reqn">F</code>-value and sample size from a previous study to correct the
noncentrality parameter associated with the effect of interest for
publication bias and/or uncertainty. This new estimated noncentrality
parameter is then used to calculate the necessary per-group sample size to
achieve the desired level of power in the planned study.
</p>
<p>The approach uses a likelihood function of a truncated non-central F
distribution, where the truncation occurs due to small effect sizes being
unobserved due to publication bias. The numerator of the likelihood
function is simply the density of a noncentral F distribution. The
denominator is the power of the test, which serves to truncate the
distribution. Thus, the ratio of the numerator and the denominator is a
truncated noncentral F distribution. (See Taylor &amp; Muller, 1996, Equation
2.1. and Anderson &amp; Maxwell,  2017, for more details.)
</p>
<p>Assurance is the proportion of times that power will be at or above the
desired level, if the experiment were to be reproduced many times. For
example, assurance = .5 means that power will be above the desired level
half of the time, but below the desired level the other half of the time.
Selecting assurance = .5 (selecting the noncentrality parameter at the 50th
percentile of the likelihood distribution) results in a median-unbiased
estimate of the population noncentrality parameter and does not correct for
uncertainty. In order to correct for uncertainty, assurance &gt; .5
can be selected, which corresponds to selecting the noncentrality parameter
associated with the (1 - assurance) quantile of the likelihood
distribution.
</p>
<p>If the previous study of interest has not been subjected to publication
bias (e.g., a pilot study), <code>alpha.prior</code> can be set to 1 to indicate
no publication bias. Alternative <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>-levels can also be
accommodated to represent differing amounts of publication bias. For
example, setting <code>alpha.prior</code>=.20 would reflect less severe
publication bias than the default of .05. In essence, setting
<code>alpha.prior</code> at .20 assumes that studies with <code class="reqn">p</code>-values less
than .20 are published, whereas those with larger <code class="reqn">p</code>-values are not.
</p>
<p>In some cases, the corrected noncentrality parameter for a given level of
assurance will be estimated to be zero. This is an indication that, at the
desired level of assurance, the previous study's effect cannot be
accurately estimated due to high levels of uncertainty and bias. When this
happens, subsequent sample size planning is not possible with the chosen
specifications. Two alternatives are recommended. First, users can select a
lower value of assurance (e.g. .8 instead of .95). Second, users can reduce
the influence of publciation bias by setting <code>alpha.prior</code> at a value
greater than .05. It is possible to correct for uncertainty only by setting
<code>alpha.prior</code>=1 and choosing the desired level of assurance. We
encourage users to make the adjustments as minimal as possible.
</p>
<p><code>ss.power.ba</code> assumes that the planned study will have equal n.
Unequal n in the previous study is handled in the following way for
between-subjects anova designs. If the user enters an N not equally
divisible by the number of cells, the function calculates n by dividing N
by the number of cells and both rounding up and rounding down the result,
effectively assuming equal n. The suggested sample size for the planned
study is calculated using both of these values of n, and the function
returns the larger of these two suggestions, to be conservative. The
adjusted noncentrality parameter that is output is the lower of the two
possibilities, again, to be conservative. Although equal-n previous studies
are preferable, this approach will work well as long as the cell sizes are
only slightly discrepant.
