<h2>Iterate Sample Size in One Parameter Group Testing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Increasing number of groups (assays, bulk samples) for a fixed group size in a binomial group testing design,
until a pre-specified power is achieved. At the same time, bias of the estimator is controlled. A hypothetical
threshold proportion p.hyp and the absolute difference delta to be detected have to be specified. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nDesign(nmax, s, delta, p.hyp, conf.level = 0.95, 
power = 0.8, alternative = "two.sided", method = "CP", biasrest = 0.05)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The power of a confidence interval here is defined as the probability that a confidence interval or limit excludes the threshold parameter (p.hyp) of the hypothesis. 
</p>
<p>This function increases the number of groups (i.e. number of observations or assays in binomial group testing) until a pre-specified power is reached 
or the maximal number of groups <kbd>nmax</kbd> (specified in the function call) is reached. 
Since the power does not increase monotone with increasing n for binomial proportions but oscillates between local maxima and minima, 
the simple iteration given here will generally result in selecting those n, for which the given CI method shows a local minimum of 
coverage if the null hypothesis is true.
Bias decreases monotone with increasing the number of groups (if other parameters are fixed)
The resulting Problems of chosing a number of groups which results in satisfactory power, are solved in the following manner:
</p>
<p>In case that the pre-specified power can be reached within the given range of n, the smallest n will be returned for which at least this power is reached, as
well as the actual power for this n.
</p>
<p>In case that the pre-specified power is not reached within the given value, that n is returned for which maximal power is achieved, and the corresponding value of power.
</p>
<p>In case that biasrestriction is violated even for the largest n within the given range of n, simply that n will be returned for which power was largest in the given range.
Due to discreteness of binomial distribution, power can be zero for one-sided hypothesis over a range of n. 
</p>
<p>The power can be identical for different methods, depending on the particular combination of n, s, p.hyp, conf.level.
</p>
<p>Especially for large n, the calculation time may become large (particularly for Blaker). Then only the range of sample size which is of interest
can be specified in nmax, f.e. as: nmax=c(150,300). Alternatively, the function bgtPower might be used instead
to calculate power and bias only for some particular combinations of n, s, delta, p.hyp,... .

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## Assume one aims to show that a proportion is smaller
## 0.005 (i.e. 0.5 per cent) with a power

## thus, to detect a delta of 0.002.
## The Clopper Pearson CI shall be used. 
## The maximal group size because of limited

## A power of 80 per cent can not be reached but
