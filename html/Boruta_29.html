<h2>Small redundant XOR data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A synthetic data set with 32 rows corresponding to all combinations of values of five logical features, A, B, N1, N2 and N3.
The decision Y is equal to A xor B, hence N1–N3 are irrelevant attributes.
The set also contains 3 additional features, A or B (AoB), A and B (AnB) and not A (nA), which provide a redundant, but still relevant way to reconstruct Y.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(srx)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 8 predictors, 4 relevant: A, B, AoB, AnB and nA, as well as 3 irrelevant N1, N2 and N3, and decision attribute Y.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is set is an easy way to demonstrate the difference between all relevant feature selection methods, which should select all features except N1–N3, and minimal optimal ones, which will probably ignore most of them.
