<h2>
Check BASIC Programs
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame of any <abbr><span class="acronym">BASIC</span></abbr> program lines that contain one or
more unexecuted statements.
Used with repeated calls of <code>RUN()</code>, this provides a test of code syntax
and accessibility.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NotRun(pretty = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pretty</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single logical value.
If <code>TRUE</code> (the default), formatted output is printed before the data frame
is returned invisibly.
If <code>FALSE</code>, the data frame is returned normally (visibly), without any
other output being printed.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame of any lines, from the currently-loaded <abbr><span class="acronym">BASIC</span></abbr>
program, containing one or more unexecuted statements.
Lines are listed with both their <abbr><span class="acronym">BASIC</span></abbr> line numbers and the
corresponding file line numbers of the source script.
A persistent appearance here may, but does not necessarily, signify a problem
with the line.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><abbr><span class="acronym">BASIC</span></abbr> <code>ON</code> and <code>IF-THEN-ELSE</code> statements contain multiple
alternative clauses.
Each such statement, as a whole, is marked as having been executed once any one
of its clauses has been run without error.
Hence, the absence of such a statement from the <code>NotRun()</code> frame does not
guarantee that all of its clauses are error-free.
