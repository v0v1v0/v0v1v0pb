<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In their study Warren et.al. (2017) conduct an experiment in which a total of
20 participants used virtual reality headsets to navigate through one of two
versions of a virtual maze. One version of the maze is the standard or
Euclidean maze. The other version of the maze, the non-Euclidean maze, has
exactly the same layout as the standard maze apart from that it contains
wormholes by which participants can be 'teleported' from one place in the maze
to another.
</p>
<p>In a training phase participants had learned to navigate between different
pairs of start and target objects in one of two versions of the maze. The
number of trials each participants completed in this training phase was
recorded.
</p>
<p>In the test phase of the experiment participants first walked to a start
object. When they had reached this object the maze disappeared and only a
"textured groundplane" of the maze remained visible. The participants then
turned toward the location of the target object that they had remembered
during the training phase and started to walk toward the target. The angular
difference, angular error, between the initial walking direction of a
participant from the start object and the location of the target object was
recorded as an outcome variable in the experiment.The angular error is a
circular variable and can be described and analyzed using circular statistics.
</p>
<p>Apart from the between-subjects factor, the type of maze, the experiment also
included a within-subjects factor, trial number. All participants had to
complete 8 trials in the test phase of the experiment. In each of these trials
they had to walk to a specific target object. An additional within-subjects
factor is the type of target object. Pairs of start and target objects were of
two types: probe and standard. The probe objects were located near the
entrance and exit of a wormhole whereas the standard objects were located at
some distance from the wormholes. For each of these two types of objects
participants had to find 4 different targets resulting in a total of 8 trials
per participant.
