<h2>Play some Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe?</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows one to play the Ultimate version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
In the Regular version of Tic-Tac-Toe, players take turns placing their marks, with the objective of achieving three marks in a row in any direction.
9x9 Tic-Tac-Toe or more commonly known as Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, adds a twist on the regular version of
Tic-Tac-Toe that most of us have come to know. Perceive the board as a big Tic-Tac-Toe board, with
the goal being to achieve 3 big marks in any direction. Big marks are achieved by winning the corresponding
small Tic-Tac-Toe blocks. The player to move first may play anywhere on the board. However, following moves
must correspond to the same big Tic-Tac-Toe block of the small Tic-Tac-Toe board where the last move was played.
