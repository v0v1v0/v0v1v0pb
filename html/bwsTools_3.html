<h2>Balanced Incomplete Block Designs for use in Best-Worst Scaling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data.frame of 32 different balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD) that
can be used to set up best-worst scaling studies. The columns are: design,
which is an identification number that can is fed to get_bibd; t, which
is the number of items (or "treatments") one will be using in the study;
k, which is how many of the items the respondent sees per trial; r, which
is how many times the participant sees each item across all of the trials;
b, which is how many trials (or "blocks") there are in the design; and
lambda, which indicates how many times each pair of options co-occur
throughout the design. This is taken from Table 11.3 in Cochran &amp; Cox 
(1957), including only the designs where t and b are both less than or
equal to 20 (as any larger would put cognitive strain on a respondent).
