<h2>Maximum matching in a convex bipartite graph.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses Glover's (1967) algorithm to find a maximum matching in a doubly convex bipartite graph. The implementation uses a priority queue, not used by Glover, as in Lipski and Preparata (1981).
Of limited interest to most users; function glover() would typically be called by other functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">glover(left, right)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>left</code></td>
<td>
<p> Treated person i may be matched to controls j with left[i] &lt;= j &lt;= right[i]. There are length(left) treated individuals and length(left)=length(right). Must have left[i]&lt;=right[i] for every i.  Define maxc = max(right).  Then there are maxc potential control, labeled 1, 2,..., maxc.  The values in left and right are these labels for controls.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The match produced by glover is rarely useful in observational studies, because it finds a match, not the closest match, not the minimum distance match.
</p>
<p>The glover algorithm may be used to find the smallest feasible caliper on a certain criterion.  Each caliper on the criterion creates a different convex bipartite graph. Use glover to check whether a particular caliper is feasible. Use bisection search to find the smallest caliper that permits a match. There are many variations on this theme.
</p>
<p>The glover algorithm is much faster than optimal matching.  Iterative use of glover's algorithm is often faster than a single minimum distance match.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p> The maximum matching ratio. A perfect matching has every treated individual i matched to a different control j with left[i] &lt;= j &lt;= right[i].  A perfect matching may not exist. A number smaller than 1 is returned if no perfect matching exists.  Otherwise, 1 is returned.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># A perfect matching exists, and glover produces one.
left&lt;-c(2,1,1,4,5)
right&lt;-c(4,3,1,5,5)
glover(left,right)

# No perfect matching exists, and glover returns maximum matching ratio.
# Treated 4 and treated 5 can only be matched to control 5.
