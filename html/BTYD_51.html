<h2>Create Frequency Customer-by-Time Matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a customer-by-time matrix with total number of transactions per time period.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dc.CreateFreqCBT(elog)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>elog</code></td>
<td>
<p>event log, which is a data frame with columns for customer ID
("cust"), date ("date"), and optionally other columns such as "sales". Each
row represents an event, such as a transaction. If the dates are not
formatted to be in the order year-month-day, the columns of the
customer-by-time matrix may not be ordered chronologically if the "date"
column does not consist of date objects (R will order them alphabetically).
This will cause problems with other functions, so it is better to convert
the date column to date objects before running this function.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Frequency customer-by-time matrix.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Create event log from file "cdnowElog.csv", which has
# customer IDs in the second column, dates in the third column, and
# sales numbers in the fifth column.
elog &lt;- dc.ReadLines(system.file("data/cdnowElog.csv", package="BTYD"),2,3,5)

# Given that the dates are in the order year-month-day,
# it is not strictly necessary to convert the date column
# to date formats. However, it is good practice:
elog[,"date"] &lt;- as.Date(elog[,"date"], "%Y%m%d")

freq.cbt &lt;- dc.CreateFreqCBT(elog)
