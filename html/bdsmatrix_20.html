<h2>
Create a sparse symmetric block diagonal matrix object
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sparse block diagonal matrices are used in the the large parameter matrices
that can arise in random-effects coxph and survReg models.  This routine
creates such a matrix.  Methods for these matrices allow them to be 
manipulated much like an ordinary matrix, but the total memory use can be
much smaller.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bdsmatrix(blocksize, blocks, rmat, dimnames)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blocksize</code></td>
<td>

<p>vector of sizes for the matrices on the diagonal
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blocks</code></td>
<td>

<p>contents of the diagonal blocks, strung out as a vector
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rmat</code></td>
<td>

<p>the dense portion of the matrix, forming a right and lower border
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dimnames</code></td>
<td>

<p>a list of dimension names for the matrix
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Consider the following matrix, which has been divided into 4 parts.
</p>
<p>1  2  0  0  0 | 4  5
2  1  0  0  0 | 6  7
0  0  3  1  2 | 8  8
0  0  1  4  3 | 1  1
0  0  2  3  5 | 2  2
————–+—–
4  6  8  1  2 | 7  6
5  7  8  1  2 | 6  9
</p>
<p>The upper left is block diagonal, and can be stored in a compressed form
without the zeros.  With a large number of blocks, the zeros can
actually account for over 99% of a matrix; this commonly happens with
the kinship matrix for a large collection of families (one block/family).
The arguments to this routine would be block sizes of 2 and 3, along with
a 2 by 7 "right hand" matrix.  Since the matrix is symmetrical, the bottom
slice is not needed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of type bdsmatrix
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># The matrix shown above is created by
tmat &lt;- bdsmatrix(c(2,3), c(1,2,1, 3,1,2, 4,3, 5),
                  rmat=matrix(c(4,6,8,1,2,7,6, 5,7,8,1,2,6,9), ncol=2))

# Note that only the lower part of the blocks is needed, however, the
#  entire block set is also allowed, i.e., c(1,2,2,1, 3,1,2,1,4,3,2,3,5)
