<h2>Use Packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Use packages in R scripts by loading their namespace and attaching a
package environment including (a subset of) their exports to the
search path.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">use(package, include.only)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code id="package">package</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string given the name of a package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="include.only">include.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of names of objects to
include in the attached environment frame.  If missing, all exports
are included.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a simple wrapper around <code>library</code> which always
uses <code>attach.required = FALSE</code>, so that packages listed in the
<code>Depends</code> clause of the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file of the package to
be used never get attached automatically to the search path.
</p>
<p>This therefore allows to write R scripts with full control over what
gets found on the search path.  In addition, such scripts can easily
be integrated as package code, replacing the calls to <code>use</code> by
the corresponding <code>ImportFrom</code> directives in ‘<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>’
files.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>(invisibly) a logical indicating whether the package to be used is
available.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This functionality is still experimental: interfaces may change in
future versions.
