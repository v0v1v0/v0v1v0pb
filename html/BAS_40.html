<h2>Hald Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Hald data have been used in many books and papers to illustrate variable
selection. The data relate to an engineering application that was concerned
with the effect of the composition of cement on heat evolved during
hardening. The response variable <em>Y</em> is the <em>heat evolved</em> in a
cement mix. The four explanatory variables are ingredients of the mix, X1:
<em>tricalcium aluminate</em>, X2: <em>tricalcium silicate</em>, X3:
<em>tetracalcium alumino ferrite</em>, X4: <em>dicalcium silicate</em>. An
important feature of these data is that the variables X1 and X3 are highly
correlated, as well as the variables X2 and X4.  Thus we should expect any
subset of (X1,X2,X3,X4) that includes one variable from highly correlated
pair to do as any subset that also includes the other member.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>hald</code> is a dataframe with 13 observations and 5 variables
(columns),
</p>
<p>Y: Heat evolved per gram of cement (in calories) X1: Amount of tricalcium
aluminate X2: Amount of tricalcium silicate X3: Amount of tetracalcium
alumino ferrite X4: Amount of dicalcium silicate
