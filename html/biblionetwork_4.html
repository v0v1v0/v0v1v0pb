<h2>Creating Co-Authorship Network with Different Measures for Weights</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates an edge list for co-authorship networks from a data frame with a list of entities and their publications.
The weight of edges can be calculated following different methods. The nodes of the network could be indifferently authors,
institutions or countries.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coauth_network(
  dt,
  authors,
  articles,
  method = c("full_counting", "fractional_counting", "fractional_counting_refined"),
  cosine_normalized = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dt</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data frame with authors (or institutions or countries) and the list of documents they have published.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>authors</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column name of the source identifiers, that is the authors (or institutions or countries).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>articles</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column name of the documents identifiers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Method for calculating the edges weights, to be chosen among "full_counting","fractional_counting" or "fractional_counting_refined".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cosine_normalized</code></td>
<td>
<p>Possibility to take into account the total number of articles written by two linked authors and to normalize the weight of their link
using Salton's cosine.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Weights can be calculated with:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> the <code>"full_counting"</code> method: the linkds between authors correspond to their absolute number of collaborations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <code>"fractional_counting"</code> method which takes into account the number of authors in each article,
following (Perianes-Rodriguez et al. 2016) equation:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\sum_{k = 1}^{M} \frac{a_{ik}.a_{jk}}{n_{k}-1}</code>
</p>
<p> with M the total number of articles, <code class="reqn">a_{ik}.a_{jk}</code>
which takes 1 if author i and j have co-written the article k, and <code class="reqn">n_{k}</code> the number of authors for article k.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <code>fractional_counting_refined</code> method, inspired by (Leydesdorff and Park 2017)
which is similar to <code>fractional_counting</code> but which is formalised in a way
that allows the sum of weights to equal the number of articles in the corpus: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\sum_{k = 1}^{M} \frac{a_{ik}.a_{jk}.2}{n_{k}.(n_{k}-1)}</code>
</p>
<p>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, it is possible to take into account the total number of collaborations of two linked authors.
If <code>cosine_normalized</code> is set to <code>True</code>, the weight calculated with one of the three methods above is divided by
<code class="reqn">\sqrt{C_{i}.C_{j}}</code>, with <code class="reqn">C_{i}</code> being the number of articles co-written by author i.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.table with the authors (or institutions or countries) identifier in <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> columns, with a <code>weight</code> column
whose values depend on the method chosen. It also keeps a copy of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> in the <code>Source</code> and <code>Target</code> columns. This is useful is you
are using the tidygraph package then, where <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> values are modified when creating a graph.
