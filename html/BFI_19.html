Trauma patients from different hospitals
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set consists of data of 371 trauma patients from three hospitals.
The binary variable <code>mortality</code> is used as an outcome, and variables <code>age</code>, <code>sex</code>, the Injury Severity Score (<code>ISS</code>, ranging from 1 (low) to 75 (high)) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (<code>GCS</code>, which expresses the level of consciousness, ranging from 3 (low) to 15 (high)) are used as covariates.
There are three types of hospitals: peripheral hospital without a neuro-surgical unit (<code>Status = 1</code>), peripheral hospital with a neuro-surgical unit (<code>Status = 2</code>), and academic medical center (<code>Status = 3</code>). Originally, the data come from a multi center study collected with a different aim. For educational purposes minor changes have been made, see the references below.
