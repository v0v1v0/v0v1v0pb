<h2>Conversion of a network matrix into a (weighted) edge list</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This helper function converts a bipartite matrix into an edge list, optionally weighted, as used by other packages and software, and writes this to the hard drive (optionally)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">web2edges(web, webName=NULL, weight.column=TRUE, both.directions=FALSE, 
	is.one.mode=FALSE, out.files=c("edges", "names", "groups")[1:2],
	return=TRUE, verbose=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>web</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix with lower trophic level species as rows, higher trophic level species 
as columns and number of interactions as entries.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>webName</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional name for the data file generated by the function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight.column</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical; is the web quantitative and should hence a weighted edge list be produced? Defaults to TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>both.directions</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical; shall each link be represented twice, i.e. once from A to B and also from B to A? Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>is.one.mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical; if TRUE, labels for species will be used as they currently are in the web; otherwise, species will be re-labelled so that the first column will have number NROW(web) + 1. This is also the default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>out.files</code></td>
<td>
<p>String indicating which files to produce: "edges" writes an edge list, "names" writes a list with names belonging to the edges and "groups" writes a file assigning the species to higher and lower trophic levels. The default produces the edge list and the names file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical; shall the edge list be returned by this function (for future use in R)? Defaults to TRUE. Setting <span class="option">return</span> to FALSE will cause writing of files to the hard drive!</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical; shall some feedback tell you that the files have been generated? Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Many network programs (e.g. Pajek) require input in the form of an edge list. Here each species is a number. The edge list has two column, one with the target and one with the origin of the connection. That means an interaction between 1 and 6 would be written (in one line) as:  <code>1  6</code>. In a weighted edge list, a third column represents the strength of the interaction: <code>1  6  4.77</code>.
</p>
<p>All this function does is to transform the typical interaction matrix used in bipartite into an edge list. Within R this could be used e.g. in the package <span class="pkg">tnet</span>; outside R by Pajek or others.
</p>
<p>Similar to <code>as.one.mode</code> this function is there to increase interchange between different coding standards and packages.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix (“edge list”) with two (unweighted) or three (weighted) columns. 
</p>
<p>If return=FALSE, this matrix (and possibly names and groups) are written to a text-file in the working directory.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

 
<p>The function is used as export helper (default) or as link to <span class="pkg">tnet</span> (with return=TRUE).
