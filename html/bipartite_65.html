<h2>
Calculates the rank of a species in a matrix sorted for maximum nestedness
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Ranks species according to their generality, which is measured as the position in the nestedness matrix. A generalist will interact with more species and thus have a rank closer to 1, while specialists (and rare species) will have ranks with higher values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nestedrank(web, method = "NODF", weighted=TRUE, normalise=TRUE, return.matrix=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>web</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix with elements of a set (e.g., plants) as rows, elements of a second set (e.g., pollinators) as columns and number of interactions as entries.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more of the following: <span class="option">NODF</span>, <span class="option">nodf</span>, <span class="option">binmatnest</span>, <span class="option">wine</span>, <span class="option">sort</span>. See details for details on each method.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weighted</code></td>
<td>
<p>For NODF and wine only: should the number of interactions per link be used as weights? See help of <code>nestednodf</code> in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>normalise</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical; defaulting to TRUE. Divides the rank-1 by the number of species -1, thereby ranging it between 0 (most generalist) and 1 (most specialised).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, defaulting to FALSE. Should the matrix resulting from the nestedness-sorting be returned as well?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The idea is to re-arrange the network matrix according to its nestedness, so that the most “generalist” species with most links will be in the first row/column and decreasing from there. The nestedness matrix can be computed in different ways. There are four different methods currently available:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>NODF (or nodf)</dt>
<dd>
<p>will use <span class="pkg">vegan</span>'s  <code>nestednodf</code>-function to arrange the matrix. With <span class="option">weighted=TRUE</span>, which is the default, it will use the actual number of interactions, rather than the number of links</p>
</dd>
<dt>binmatnest</dt>
<dd>
<p>will use the <span class="pkg">vegan</span>'s <code>nestedtemp</code>-function to arrange the matrix. This is only using binary information, so weighting has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>wine</dt>
<dd>
<p>will use the <code>wine</code>-function to arrange the matrix. When <span class="option">weighted=FALSE</span>, wine will be applied to a binary matrix.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sort</dt>
<dd>
<p>will simply sort the matrix by marginal totals (i.e. by number of interactions per species when <span class="option">weighted=TRUE</span> or by number links (=degree) when <span class="option">weighted=FALSE</span>. In this case the rank simply represents the abundance of the species in this network.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of nestedness ranks vectors for the lower and higher trophic level (smallest value for the most generalist). If <span class="option">return.matrix=TRUE</span>, a third list entry will contain the nested matrix.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Since nestedness is itself not a straight-forward measure of something ecologically meaningful, also these ranks may or may not be. At least there is a high chance that they represent merely abundance of each species. See example for an idea on how to check for the effect of abundance as such.
