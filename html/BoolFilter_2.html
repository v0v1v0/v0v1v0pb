<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A novel state-space signal model has been proposed for stochastic Boolean dynamical systems observed through noisy measurements, of which the Boolean Kalman Filter is the optimal MMSE estimator. State evolution is governed by Boolean functions (i.e. logic gates) and noise. The current system state, in which transitions between Boolean states can be perturbed by some process noise, creating an ergodic state transition matrix, is observed through an arbitrary noisy measurement. The optimal recursive MMSE estimator for this model is called the Boolean Kalman Filter (BKF), and an efficient algorithm has been proposed for its exact computation. This algorithm is presented here.
</p>
<p>The Boolean Kalman Filtering algorithm can handle various observation models, including Bernoulli, Gaussian, Poisson, and Negative-Binomial, based on the input to the <code>obsModel</code> parameters. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bernoulli observation model requires only one parameter, aside from declaring the type, e.g. <br><br><code>obsModel = list(type = 'Bernoulli', q = 0.05)</code>
<br></p>
</li>
<li> <p>Gaussian observation model requires a vector of the observation parameters, which include the mean and standard deviation of Boolean variables in inactivated and activated states. This will be defined as a vector, e.g. <br><br><code>mu0 = 1</code> <br><code>sigma0 = 2</code><br><code>mu1 = 5</code><br><code>sigma1 = 2</code><br><code>obsModel = list(type = 'Gaussian', model = c(mu0, sigma0, mu1, sigma1))</code>
<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Poisson observation model requires a list of parameters. This list will have 3 entries in addition to the type definition, for a total of 4 entries:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sequencing depth <code>s</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baseline espression in inactivated state, referred to as <code>mu</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The differential expression, referred to as <code>delta</code>, which must be input as a vector of the same length as the number of Boolean variables in the network.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the user can define the exact observation parameter for each individual gene. For a 4-gene network, a potential <code>obsModel</code> parameter for a Poisson distribution could be defined as:<br><br><code>obsModel = list(type = 'Poisson', s = 10.875, mu = 0.01, delta = c(2, 2, 2, 2))</code>
<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative-Binomial observation model also requires a list of parameters. This list will have 4 entries in addition to the type definition, for a total of 5 entries:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sequencing depth <code>s</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baseline espression in inactivated state, referred to as <code>mu</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differential expression, referred to as <code>delta</code>,  which must be input as a vector of the same length as the number of Boolean variables in the network.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inverse Dispersion, referred to as <code>phi</code>, which must also be input as a vector of the same length as the number of Boolean variables in the network.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a 4-gene network, a potential <code>obsModel</code> parameter for a Negative-Binomial observation model could be defined as:<br><br><code>delta = c(2, 2, 2, 2)</code> <br><code>phi = c(3, 3, 3, 3)</code> <br><code>obsModel = list(type = 'NB', s = 10.875, mu = 0.01, delta, phi)</code>
<br></p>
</li>
</ul>
