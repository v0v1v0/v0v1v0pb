<h2>Segment Pedigree into Extended Families</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function adds an extended family ID variable to a pedigree by segmenting that dataset into independent extended families
using the weakly connected components algorithm.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ped2fam(
  ped,
  personID = "ID",
  momID = "momID",
  dadID = "dadID",
  famID = "famID"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ped</code></td>
<td>
<p>a pedigree dataset.  Needs ID, momID, and dadID columns</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>personID</code></td>
<td>
<p>character.  Name of the column in ped for the person ID variable</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>momID</code></td>
<td>
<p>character.  Name of the column in ped for the mother ID variable</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dadID</code></td>
<td>
<p>character.  Name of the column in ped for the father ID variable</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>famID</code></td>
<td>
<p>character.  Name of the column to be created in ped for the family ID variable</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The general idea of this function is to use person ID, mother ID, and father ID to
create an extended family ID such that everyone with the same family ID is in the
same (perhaps very extended) pedigree.  That is, a pair of people with the same family ID
have at least one traceable relation of any length to one another.
</p>
<p>This function works by turning the pedigree into a mathematical graph using the igraph
package.  Once in graph form, the function uses weakly connected components to search
for all possible relationship paths that could connect anyone in the data to anyone
else in the data.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A pedigree dataset with one additional column for the newly created extended family ID
