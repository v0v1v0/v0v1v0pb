<h2>
Unfinished Methods to help vision impaired useRs
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of methods that will (once coded) extract the most relevant information from a graphical object (or implied set of graphical objects) and display the interpreted results in text form.
</p>
<p>The method includes representations of summary methods that are more suitable for blind useRs. For example, the method for a data.frame uses a single line for each variable instead of the normal column layout used by the <code>summary</code> method.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is the help page for the VI() functions that are not fully functional or below par in some way.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This will vary according to the needs of vision impaired useRs and the specific objects that need to be interpreted.
</p>
<p>In general, the output is a series of text strings printed in the console/terminal window in addition to the embedded command's normal functionality.
</p>
<p>These functions do not create objects as do many <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> commands. Manipulations on the objects created by regular <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> expressions will need those regular expressions issued in addition to those of the VI family of functions.
