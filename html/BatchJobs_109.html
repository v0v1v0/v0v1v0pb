<h2>Sweep obsolete files from the file system.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes R scripts, log files, resource informations and temporarily stored configuration files
from the registry's file directory. Assuming all your jobs completed successfully, none of these are needed
for further work. This operation potentially releases quite a lot of disk space, depending on the number of your jobs.
BUT A HUGE WORD OF WARNING:
IF you later notice something strange and need to determine the reason for it, you are at a huge disadvantage.
Only do this at your own risk and when you are sure that you have successfully completed a project and only
want to archive your produced experiments and results.
</p>
