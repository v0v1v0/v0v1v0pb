<h2>Create a bounding box in an image based on selected points</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>boxer</code> allows the user to identify an area in an image around which to
generate a bounding box and set a common classifier for all images.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">boxer(
  names,
  file_path_input,
  color = "red",
  resize_x = NA,
  resize_y = NA,
  classifier = NA,
  batch = length(names),
  outbox = FALSE,
  file_path_output = NA,
  show_classifier = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Stream a series of images (JPEG, PNG, BMP) from a directory. As each image
appears, indicate between 2 and 26 points around which boxer will calculate a
bounding box. The name of the original file, the bounding box coordinates, and
optional image resize values, classifier and box color are returned in a
dataframe. Boxer also offers the option to call the outBox function that
will output each image with its bounding box. If outputting the images, the
show_classifier parameter controls whether or not to show the class as a label
above the bounding box.
</p>
<p>When an image appears, use the left mouse button to select the series of
points, and the right mouse button to signal completion and to move to the
next image. At least two points must be selected to record a bounding box. If
more than 26 points are selected, only the first 26 will be used. To skip
creating a bounding box for the current image, select the right mouse button
without selecting any points. Messages noting the images skipped will appear
at the end.
</p>
<p>The dataframe of bounding box coordinates will only be returned when all of
the images have been cycled through, unless you set the batch parameter.  The
batch parameter allows for the images to be processed in batches with the
option to terminate and generate the output file at the end of each batch. The
batch parameter can be set for the number of images to cycle through before
the user is prompted to truncate the stream. Selecting "y" at the prompt will
truncate the stream and return the bounding box coordinates for all of the
images up to that point. Selecting any other key will continue to stream
through the next batch of images.
</p>
<p>If using the classifier and color parameters, boxer assumes all of the images
are classified the same. To be able to set the classifier per bounding box, or
to be able to generate multiple bounding boxes per image, use the boxer2
function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with the bounding box coordinates and classifier for each
image. Note the y-coordinate extends downward, not upward. Will also output
new image file with the bounding box annotation for each of the images
processed if outbox is set to T. The name of each output image file will be
the same as the corresponding input file prefixed with "out_".
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
boxer_results &lt;- boxer(names = c("S2.jpg"),
file_path_input = system.file("extdata", package = "boundingbox"),
resize_x = 224, resize_y = 224, classifier = "dog", outbox = FALSE)

## End(Not run)
