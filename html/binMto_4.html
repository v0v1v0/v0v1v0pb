<h2> Approximate power (any rejection!) for many-to-one comparison of binomial proportions </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Approximative power to reject the hypothesis that all of the k differences 
of proportions of treatment groups vs. control group are zero, i.e.:
probability to reject any H0[i]: p[i]-p[0] = 0, For a given setting of n[i], and p[i]
assumed under the alternative.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">apprPower(n, pH1, alpha = 0.05, alternative = "greater", method = "Add4")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function uses approximative calculation of any-pair-power of a maximum test as described in Bretz and Hothorn (2002) for a
Wald test of multiple contrasts of binary data. Differing from Bretz and Hothorn (2002), unpooled variance estimators are used in the
present function. In case of "Add4" and "Add2"-method, the Wald expectation and variance are replaced by that of add-4 and add-2.
Since the approximate calculation assumes normality, this function can give misleading results, if sample size is small and/or proportions
of success are extreme. 
The present function only calcualtes power for the test adjusting via the multivariate-normal-distribution.
For Bonferroni-adjusted or unadjusted tests, one can make use of well-known formulas for power and sample size for binary data.
</p>
<p>The use of the function simPower in this package will result in power estimation closer to the true performance of the methods but is less convenient.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a single numeric value: the approximate any-pair power
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The results of this functions are roughly checked by comparison with results of power simualtion, which indicate that the approximations are reasonable for
at least moderate n and not too extreme proportions.
The performance of a corresponding test using the add-4 or add-2 adjustment is not described.
