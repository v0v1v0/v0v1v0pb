<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of example files relevant to emailing with R Markdown in RStudio

that work together to provide a full report, an emailable version of that
report, and a file attachment; these files are:
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">prepare_rsc_example_files(path = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>The location to which the files (in a subdirectory named
<code>"connect_examples"</code>) will be written. The path needs to exist but the
aforementioned subdirectory is not required to be present.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>"connect-example-main.Rmd"</code>: The main R Markdown document. Contains
a report template culminating in a final R code chunk that has calls to
<code>render_connect_email()</code> and <code>attach_connect_email()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"connect-example-email.Rmd"</code>: An R Markdown document that contains
the email message. It is associated with the main R Markdown document by
incorporating some of its content (i.e., by reusing chunk names and extending
assigned values). It uses the <code>blastula::blastula_email</code> output type in the
YAML front matter.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"austin_home_sales.csv"</code>: A CSV file that will be included as an
attachment by way of the <code>attachments</code> argument in the
<code>attach_connect_email()</code> function call within the main R Markdown document.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main report and associated email can be published by opening
<code>"connect-example-main.Rmd"</code> and pressing the Publish button at the top-right
of the Editor pane (please ensure beforehand that you are set up work with
RStudio Connect). If asked <code>"What do you want to publish?"</code>, choose the first
option where only the <code>"connect-example-main"</code> document is published. All
three files should be checked in the final dialog box, press the <code>Publish</code>
button to publish to RStudio Connect.
</p>
<p>There is also the single <code>"connect-example-text-only.Rmd"</code> file that, when
published, serves as a mechanism to send a text-only email. The content of
the email is specified directly in the single <code>attach_connect_email()</code>
function call and all other text in the R Markdown file is disregarded.
