<h2>Tissue type and transcription factor binding data during Drosophila mesoderm
development</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Zinzen et al. (2009) measured in vivo transcription factor binding for five
key transcription factors using ChIP-chip assays at two hour intervals during
drosophila mesoderm development. The five transcription factors are: Twist
(Twi), Tinman (Tin), Myocyte enhancing factor 2 (Mef2), Bagpipe (Bap), and
Biniou (Bin). Both Twi and Tin were assayed from 2-8 hours, Mef2 from 2-12
hours, Bap from 6-8 hours, and Bin from 6-12 hours. In addition, Zinzen et
al. identified six tissue types based on tissue specific expression: mesoderm
(Meso), somatic muscle (SM), visceral muscle (VM), cardiac muscle (CM),
mesoderm and somatic muscle (Meso&amp;SM), and somatic and visceral muscle
(SM&amp;VM). All data are binary and measured at 310 cis-regulatory modules.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(drosophila)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"list"</code> containing tissue type and
transcription factor binding data. The first element in the list is a matrix
which contains the data in the original form. The second element in the list
is a matrix that contains the binary data. For this matrix any value greater
than zero to changed to a one. For both data sets the tissue type data
appears in the first six columns of the data matrix and the remaining 15
columns contain the transcription factor binding data.
