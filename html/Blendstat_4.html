<h2>Dataset, natural cherry coffee.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Database of coffee blends of different varieties processed by dry via.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(DataNAT)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Database of coffee blends of different varieties processed by dry via. Formed by the variables: Exp (code of the experiments); CEB (specialty Bourbon Yellow coffee produced at an altitude above 1,200m); CT (roasted commercial coffee); CC (Conillon coffee); CEA (Acaia specialty coffee produced at altitude below 1,100m); Conc (concentrations at 7% and 10% (w/v) of roasted and ground coffee beans in 100 ml of water). Variable responses defined by sensory attributes: Body, Taste, Acidity, Bitterness, Score.</p>
