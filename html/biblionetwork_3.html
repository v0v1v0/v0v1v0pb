<h2>Calculating the Coupling Angle Measure for Edges</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the number of references that different articles share together, as well as
the coupling angle value of edges in a bibliographic coupling network (Sen and Gan 1983), from a direct
citation data frame. This is a standard way to build bibliographic coupling network using Salton's cosine measure:
it divides the number of references that two articles share by the square root of the product of
both articles bibliography lengths. It avoids giving too much importance to articles with a large bibliography.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">biblio_coupling(
  dt,
  source,
  ref,
  normalized_weight_only = TRUE,
  weight_threshold = 1,
  output_in_character = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dt</code></td>
<td>
<p>For bibliographic coupling (or co-citation), the dataframe with citing and cited documents. It could also be used
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> for title co-occurence network, with <code>source</code> being the articles,
and <code>ref</code> being the list of words in articles titles;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> for co-authorship network,
with <code>source</code> being the authors, and <code>ref</code> the list of articles.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>source</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column name of the source identifiers, that is the documents that are citing. In a coupling network, these documents
are the nodes of the network.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ref</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column name of the cited references identifiers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>normalized_weight_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set to FALSE, the function returns the weights normalized by the cosine measure,
but also the number of shared references.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight_threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Corresponds to the value of the non-normalized weights of edges. The function just keeps the edges
that have a non-normalized weight superior to the <code>weight_threshold</code>. In other words, if you set the
parameter to 2, the function keeps only the edges between nodes that share at least two references
in common in their bibliography. In a large bibliographic coupling network,
you can consider for instance that sharing only one reference is not sufficient/significant for two articles to be linked together.
This parameter could also be modified to avoid creating intractable networks with too many edges.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output_in_character</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the function ends by transforming the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> columns in character, to make the
creation of a <a href="https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html">tidygraph</a> network easier.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function implements the following weight measure:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{R(A) \bullet R(B)}{\sqrt{L(A).L(B)}}</code>
</p>

<p>with <code class="reqn">R(A)</code> and <code class="reqn">R(B)</code> the references of document A and document B, <code class="reqn">R(A) \bullet R(B)</code>
being the number of shared references by A and B, and <code class="reqn">L(A)</code> and <code class="reqn">L(B)</code>
the length of the bibliographies of document A and document B.
</p>
<p>This function uses data.table package and is thus very fast. It allows the user to compute the coupling angle
on a very large data frame quickly.
</p>
<p>This function is a relatively general function that can also be used
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> for co-citation networks (just by inversing the <code>source</code> and <code>ref</code> columns).
If you want to avoid confusion, rather use the <code>biblio_cocitation()</code> function.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> for title co-occurence networks (taking care of
the length of the title thanks to the coupling angle measure);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> for co-authorship networks (taking care of the
number of co-authors an author has collaborated with on a period). For co-authorship,
rather use the <code>coauth_network()</code> function.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.table with the articles (or authors) identifiers in <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> columns,
with one or two additional columns (the coupling angle measure and the number of shared references).
It also keeps a copy of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> in the <code>Source</code> and <code>Target</code> columns. This is useful is you
are using the tidygraph package after, where <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> values are modified when creating a graph.
