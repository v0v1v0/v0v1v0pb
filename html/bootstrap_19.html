<h2>  The Patch Data  </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Eight subjects wore medical patches designed to infuse a naturally-occuring
hormone into the blood stream.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(patch)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 8 observations on the following 6 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>subject</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt>placebo</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt>oldpatch</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt>newpatch</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt>z</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, oldpatch - placebo</p>
</dd>
<dt>y</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, newpatch - oldpatch</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Eight subjects wore medical patches designed to infuse a certain
naturally-occuring hormone into the blood stream. Each subject had his
blood levels of the hormone measured after wearing three different patches:
a placebo patch, an "old" patch manufactured at an older plant, and a
"new" patch manufactured at a newly opened plant. 
</p>
<p>The purpose of the study was to show <em>bioequivalence</em>. Patchs from the
old plant was already approved for sale by the FDA (food and drug 
administration). Patches from the new facility would not need a full new
approval, if they could be shown bioequivalent to the patches from 
the old plant. 
</p>
<p>Bioequivalence was defined as 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{|E(\mbox{new}) - E(\mbox{old})|}{ E(\mbox{old})-E(\mbox{placebo})}
           \le .20</code>
</p>

<p>The book uses this to investigate bias of ratio estimation.
