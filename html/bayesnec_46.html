<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Example bayesmanecfit object
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>bayesmanecfit</code>. This was created
to reduce run time in examples and tests, and to give the user an example
to toy with. This was fitted to <code>bayesnec</code> built-in mock dataset
(see ?<code>nec_data</code>), using models "nec4param" and "ecx4param".
The number of chains were set to 2 and number of iterations were 50 only
to make sure that package size was below 5 Mb. See help files for function
<code>bnec</code> and class <code>bayesmanecfit</code> for details.
