<h2>Example of raw focal observations' data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame containing an hypothetical (randomly generated) focal
observations' data set to be passed to dtable(). This example contains 100
focal samples in a group of 9 subjects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ex_field_data
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame containing raw focal observations' data, referring to
dyadic social interactions. This data frame contains one focal observation
per row and 3 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id1</dt>
<dd>
<p>focal subject's identification code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>act</dt>
<dd>
<p>recorded social interactions (SIs) in each focal sample.</p>
</dd>
<dt>obs</dt>
<dd>
<p>observer's identification code.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In this example two different SIs were recorded (coded + and -); SIs
codes, subjects' id codes, and separation characters should not overlap. The
. character is used to separate subjects' id codes from the SIs' codes, and
the ; character is used to separate different SIs occurring within the same
focal sample. Whenever a subject's id appears before a SI's code it means
that, that subject initiated a SI with the focal subject (see row 6);
whenever a subject's id appears after the SI's it means that the focal
subject (id1 column) initiated a SI with that subject (see row 4). For
example, the 4th row indicates that the focal subject s1 initiated a +
social interaction with subject s4, while the 6th row indicates that the
focal subject s5 was involved in two social interactions- the first
initiated by s4 (-), the second (+) initiated by s2. 0s in this column refer
to focal observations where no SIs were recorded, and xs refer to focal
observations where the focal subject was unavailable for observation.
