<h2> Calculates an unbiased estimate of Regional Random Isonymy </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>"rri" calculates an unbiased estimate of Regional Random Isonymy starting from surname frequencies. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rri(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p> is a surname frequency table where the N rows correspond to the surnames present in the whole population and the M columns are the (sub)populations </p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function implements Morton's isonymy method as outlined by Relethford. 
Unbiased estimate of Regional Random Isonymy refers to random isonymy of the contemporary region relative to the founding population. This value is an argument needed to calculate 'a priori' and conditional kinship matrices using the "rel.phi" and "rel.cond" functions.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns one numeric value. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The use of “rri” could be problematic, because different people are likely to arrange isonymy data in different ways on their computers. We decided for a matrix format for the isonymy data; the function would originally accept data in a different format and then convert it internally, but this would be a problem for people with data arranged in a different format. In the end we decided to write a specific function, "sur.freq", to generate surname frequency tables directly from raw marriage data or marriage-like data (the most commonly used sources in bio-demographic studies). For other types of surname data, see the verbose explanation in the info for the dataset "surnames" so it would be clear for the user how “rri” works.
