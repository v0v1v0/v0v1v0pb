<h2>Data come from an experimental study (Rosa, Rosa, Sarner, and Barrett, 1998) 
that were also used in Howell (2012, p.196).
An experiment was conducted to investigate if Therapeutic Touch practitioners 
who were blindfolded can effectively identify which of their hands is below the experimenter¡¯s.
Twenty-eight practitioners were involved and tested 10 times in the experiment. 
Researchers expected an average of 5 correct answers from each practitioner 
as it is the number by chance if they do not outperform others.</h2>
