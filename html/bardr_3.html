<h2>bardr: providing the complete works of the Bard in tidy format.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The bardr package provides R data structures for all of William
Shakespeare's works available in the Project Gutenberg ebook. The provided
data are designed to seamlessly work in R without the hassle of data
wrangling and cleaning, which has already been performed.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Inspired by the janeaustenr package by Julia Silge: see
https://github.com/juliasilge/janeaustenr .
</p>


<h3>Complete collections</h3>

<p>The complete works are available all at one time in two separate formats.
</p>
<p>One is a named list, where each entry is a named character vector. The name
of the vector is the name of the work, and the contents of the vector are
lines of the associated text file (all lines are &lt;= 70 characters).
</p>
<p>The other is a data frame with a column for the name of the work (repeated
as many times as there are lines of content) and a column for the content
of the work, where each cell in the content column is one line of text.
