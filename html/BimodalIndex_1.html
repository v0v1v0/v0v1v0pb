<h2>The Bimodality Index</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The "bimodality index" is a continuous measure of the extent to which
a set of (univariate) data fits a two-component mixture model.  The
score is larger if the two components are balanced in size or if the
separation between the two modes is larger.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bimodalIndex(dataset, verbose=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or data.frame, usually with columns
representing samples and rows representing genes or proteins.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value; should the function output a stream
of information while it is working?</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Identifying genes with bimodal expression patterns from large-scale
expression profiling data is an important analytical task, which is
often addressed using model-based clustering. That technique commonly
uses the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) for model selection.  In practice,
however, BIC and AIC appear to be overly sensitive and may lead to the
identification of bimodally expressed genes that are unreliable or not
clinically useful.  We propose using a novel criterion, the bimodality
index, not only to identify but also to rank meaningful and reliable
bimodal patterns.
</p>
<p>We model the data as a mixture
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> \pi N(\mu_1, \sigma) + (1 - \pi) N(\mu_2, \sigma)</code>
</p>

<p>of two normal components with a common standard deviation. We define the
standardized distance between the two means to be
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\delta = \frac{|\mu_1 - \mu_2|}{\sigma}.</code>
</p>

<p>We then define the bimodality index as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">BI = \delta\sqrt{\pi(1-\pi)}.</code>
</p>

<p>The bimodality index can be computed by first using either a mixture
model-based algorithm such as Mclust or by using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to estimate the model parameters.  In
this package, we rely on the Mclust implementation.
</p>
<p>In the paper by Wang et al. referenced below, we provide a statistical
justification for the definition of the bimodality index, based on
considerations of power and sample size.  Theoretical considerations
suggest that, in the limit over the number of samples, a bimodality
index of 1.1 or greater is likely to indicate a "useful" bimodal
pattern of expression.  Higher cutoffs are needed when there are
relatively few samples, and can be chosen by simulating from the null
distribution.  We carried out simulation studies and applied
the method to real data from a lung cancer gene expression profiling
study. Our findings suggest that BIC behaves like a lax cutoff based
on the bimodality index (much smaller than 1), and that the bimodality
index provides an objective measure to identify and rank meaningful
and reliable bimodal patterns from large-scale gene expression
datasets.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame containing six columns, with the rows
corresponding to the rows of the original data set.  The columns
contain the four parameters from the normal mixture model (<code>mu1</code>,
<code>mu2</code>, <code>sigma</code>, and <code>pi</code>) along with the standardized
distance <code>delta</code> and the bimodal index <code>BI</code>.
