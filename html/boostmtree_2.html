Atrial Fibrillation Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Atrial Fibrillation (AF) data is obtained from a randomized trial to study
the effect of surgical ablation as a treatment option for AF 
among patients with persistent and
long-standing persistent AF who requires mitral valve surgery.
Patients were randomized into two groups: mitral valve
surgery with ablation and mitral valve surgery without ablation.
Patients in the ablation group were further randomized into
two types of procedure: pulmonary vain isolation (PVI)
and biatrial maze procedure.
These patients were followed weekly for a period of 12 months. The
primary outcome of the study is the presence/absence of AF
(binary longitudinal response).
Data includes 228 patients. From 228 patients, 7949 AF measurements
are available with average of 35 measurements per patient.
