<h2>Champaign, IL weather data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Champaign, IL weather data specified at hourly intervals in the CST time zone
for the years 1995â€“2023. The data includes typical inputs required for BioCro
imulations. Note: some values are missing near the start of 1995 since those
time points are not available from SURFRAD.
</p>
<p>This weather data is included in the BioCro package so users can reproduce
the calculations of Lochocki <em>et al.</em> (2022)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003">doi:10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003</a>] and for exploratory purposes; it is
likely that most BioCro studies will require different data sets, and no
attempt is made here to be exhaustive.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">weather</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of 29 named elements, where each element is a data frame corresponding
to one year of weather data and the name of each element is a year, for
example <code>'2004'</code>. Each data frame has 8760 or 8784 observations
(representing hourly time points) of 9 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>year</code>: the year
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>doy</code>: the day of year
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hour</code>: the hour
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>time_zone_offset</code>: the time zone offset relative to UTC (hr)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>precip</code>: preciptation rate (mm / hr)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rh</code>: the ambient relative humidity (dimensionless)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>solar</code>: the incoming photosynthetically active photon flux
density (PPFD) measured on a ground area basis including direct and
diffuse sunlight light just outside the crop canopy
(micromol / m^2 / s)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>temp</code>: the ambient air temperature (degrees Celsius)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>windspeed</code>: the wind speed in the ambient air just outside the
canopy (m / s)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Weather data were obtained from the public SURFRAD and WARM databases and
processed according to the method described in Lochocki <em>et al.</em> (2022)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003">doi:10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003</a>]. See version 1.2.0 of the
<code>eloch216/oscillator-based-circadian-clock-analysis</code>
<a href="https://github.com/eloch216/oscillator-based-circadian-clock-analysis">GitHub repository</a>
for a full description of the data processing.
</p>
<p>In brief, the columns in the data frames were determined from SURFRAD and WARM
variables as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>precip</code>: from the <code>precip</code> variable in the WARM data set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rh</code>: from the <code>rh</code> variable in the SURFRAD data set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>solar</code>: from the <code>par</code> variable in the SURFRAD data set;
when these values are not available, the <code>direct_n</code>,
<code>diffuse</code>, and <code>zen</code> variables are used to make an estimate
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>temp</code>: from the <code>temp</code> variable in the SURFRAD data set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>windspeed</code>: from the <code>windspd</code> variable in the SURFRAD data
set
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The WARM data set includes daily values. Hourly values for precipitation are
derived from daily totals by assuming a constant rate of precipitation
throughout the day.
</p>
<p>The SURFRAD data set includes values at 1 or 3 minute intervals. Hourly values
are determined by averaging over hourly intervals, where the value at hour
<code>h</code> is the average over the hour-long interval centered at <code>h</code>. Some
values are missing; any missing entries are filled via an interpolation
procedure based on the assumption that values at the same hour of sequential
days should be similar.
</p>
<p>The <code>time_zone_offset</code> is set to a constant value of -6 since this data
is specified in the CST time zone (i.e., UTC-6). Since the value of this
quantity does not change, it could in principle be considered a parameter
rather than a driver; however, it is included with the weather data for
convenience.
</p>
<p>To reduce size the in the BioCro repository, the raw data values are rounded.
This was done using the commands in a script that is included with the BioCro
package. This script can be located by typing
<code>system.file('BioCro', 'extdata', 'rounding_weather_values.R')</code>.
