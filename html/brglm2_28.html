<h2>Post-transfusion hepatitis: impact of non-A, non-B hepatitis
surrogate tests</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a randomized double-blind trial to assess whether
withholding donor blood positive for the non-A, non-B (<code>"NANB"</code>)
surrogate markers would reduce the frequency of post-transfusion
hepatitis.  The dataset contains <code>4588</code> subjects enrolled from 1988
to 1992 into two study groups that received allogenic blood from
which units positive for NANB surrogate markers were withheld (n =
<code>2311</code>) or not withheld (n = <code>2277</code>).  Subjects were followed up
for 6 months and assessed for the presence of post-transfusion
hepatitis.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hepatitis
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 28 rows and the following 6 columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>city</code>: Subjects were recruited from 3 Canadian Red Cross Society
Blood Centres and 13 university-affiliated hospitals in 3 cities:
Toronto, Hamilton and Winnipeg.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>group</code>: Eligible subjects were assigned to one of two allogenic
blood recipient groups.  One group received products that had only
routine Canadian transfusion-transmissible disease marker screening
(no-withhold).  The other group received only products that were
not positive for NANB surrogate markers (withhold).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>time</code>: Hepatitis C (HCV) screening was introduced in Canada in
May, 1990.  Subjects were recruited into the study before (pre) and
after (post) the introduction of anti-HCV testing.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>HCV</code>: Post-transfusion HCV hepatitis present (1) or absent (0).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nonABC</code>: Post-transfusion non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis present (1) or absent (0)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>counts</code>: Number of subjects
</p>
</li>
</ul>
