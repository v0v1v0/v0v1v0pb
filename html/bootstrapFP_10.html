<h2>Select a one-one sampling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A one-one sampling is a design for which the random variables Sk, representing
the number of times unit k is included in the sample, have expectation and
variance equal to 1. Proposed by Antal and Tille' (2011, 2014).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">one_one(n, method = c("doubled-half", "over-replacement"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer, the sample size</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>algorithm to be used, either doubled half sampling or srs with over-replacement. 
See the Details section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Antal and Tillé proposed two procedures that lead to one-one samplings.
The first one (Antal and Tillé, 2011a) in more complex and makes use of a simple 
random Sampling with over-replacement (Antal and Tillé, 2011b), 
and it is called by setting <code>method = "over-replacement"</code>.
The second one (Antal and Tillé, 2014) is the doubled half sampling, which is 
simpler and quickier to compute, and can employed by setting
<code>method = "doubled-half"</code>; this is the default option.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an integer vector of size <code>n</code>, indicating how many times each unit is
present in the sample
