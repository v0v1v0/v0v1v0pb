<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Information on bottle id, substrates and, inoculum initial masses for 12 anaerobic bottles with animal feed ingredients for substrate.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("feedSetup")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 12 observations on the following 3 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>identification code, a unique value for each bottle in the dataset. Numeric with all values from 1 to 12.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>m.inoc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>mass of inoculum added to the bottle at the start in g, a numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>m.sub.vs</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>mass of volatile solids (VS) of substrate added to the bottle at the start in g, a numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are meant to be example data for <code>summBg</code>.
Inoculum was digestate from a stable laboratory reactor (400 L) operated at mesophilic temperatures (38 degrees C) and a retention time of ca. 98 days
Substrates were cellulose, wheat straw (WS), and animal feed ingredients (FI).
Additinally, 1 mL each of a vitamin mixture and trace element solution was added to each BMP bottle.
</p>
<p>BMP tests were operated with a total volume of ca. 400 mL at 38 degrees C. 
</p>
<p>Data in <code>feedVol</code> and <code>feedSetup</code> are from the same bottles.
</p>
