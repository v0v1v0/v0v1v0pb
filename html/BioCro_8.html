<h2>Champaign, IL weather data for Soybean-BioCro</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Champaign, IL weather data specified at hourly intervals in the CST time zone
for the years 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006. The data includes typical inputs
required for BioCro simulations, with the addition of <code>day_length</code>, which
is specifically required for soybean simulations. Although this quantity can
be calculated by modules during the course of a simulation, it is included in
this weather data to speed up the simulations. The time range is restricted to
the SoyFACE growing season that was used for each year.
</p>
<p>This weather data is included in the BioCro package so users can reproduce
the calculations of Matthews <em>et al.</em> (2022)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032">doi:10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032</a>] and for exploratory purposes; it is
likely that most BioCro studies will require different data sets, and no
attempt is made here to be exhaustive.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">soybean_weather</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of 4 named elements, where each element is a data frame corresponding
to one year of weather data and the name of each element is a year, for
example <code>'2004'</code>. Each data frame has 2952 - 3384 observations
(representing hourly time points) of 14 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>year</code>: the year
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>doy</code>: the day of year
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hour</code>: the hour
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>time_zone_offset</code>: the time zone offset relative to UTC (hr)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>precip</code>: preciptation rate (mm / hr)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rh</code>: the ambient relative humidity (dimensionless)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>dw_solar</code>: downwelling global solar radiation (J / m^2 / s)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>up_solar</code>: upwelling global solar radiation (J / m^2 / s)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>netsolar</code>: net global solar radiation (downwelling - upwelling)
(J / m^2 /s)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>solar</code>: the incoming photosynthetically active photon flux
density (PPFD) measured on a ground area basis including direct and
diffuse sunlight light just outside the crop canopy
(micromol / m^2 / s)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>temp</code>: the ambient air temperature (degrees Celsius)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>windspeed</code>: the wind speed in the ambient air just outside the
canopy (m / s)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>zen</code>: the solar zenith angle (degrees)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>day_length</code>: the length of the daily photoperiod (hours)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Weather data were obtained from the public SURFRAD and WARM databases and
processed according to the method described in Matthews <em>et al.</em> (2022)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032">doi:10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032</a>]. See that paper for a full description
of the data processing.
</p>
<p>In brief, the columns in the data frames were determined from SURFRAD and WARM
variables as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>precip</code>: from the <code>precip</code> variable in the WARM data set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rh</code>: from the <code>rh</code> variable in the SURFRAD data set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>dw_solar</code>: from the <code>dw_solar</code> variable in the SURFRAD data
set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>up_solar</code>: from the <code>uw_solar</code> variable in the SURFRAD data
set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>netsolar</code>: from the <code>netsolar</code> variable in the SURFRAD data
set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>solar</code>: from the <code>par</code> variable in the SURFRAD data set;
when these values are not available, the <code>netsolar</code> and
<code>up_solar</code> variables are used to make an estimate; when these
values are also not available, the <code>dw_solar</code> variable is used to
make an estimate
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>temp</code>: from the <code>temp</code> variable in the SURFRAD data set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>windspeed</code>: from the <code>windspd</code> variable in the SURFRAD data
set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>zen</code>: from the <code>zen</code> variable in the SURFRAD data set
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>day_length</code>: calculated from <code>solar</code> using an
oscillator-based circadian clock
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The WARM data set includes daily values. Hourly values for precipitation are
derived from daily totals by assuming a constant rate of precipitation
throughout the day.
</p>
<p>The SURFRAD data set includes values at 1 or 3 minute intervals. Hourly values
are determined by averaging over hourly intervals, where the value at hour
<code>h</code> is the average over that hour. Some values are missing; any missing
entries are filled by interpolating between neighboring hours.
</p>
<p>To create this data frame, hourly values for all columns except
<code>day_length</code> are extracted from the WARM and SURFRAD data. Then, BioCro
is used to run the circadian clock model that determines photoperiod length.
(See this page for additional information about the clock model:
<code>soybean_clock</code>.) The result from this calculation is then
appended to the weather data frame as a new column.
</p>
<p>The <code>time_zone_offset</code> is set to a constant value of -6 since this data
is specified in the CST time zone (i.e., UTC-6). Since the value of this
quantity does not change, it could in principle be considered a parameter
rather than a driver; however, it is included with the weather data for
convenience.
</p>
<p>To reduce size the in the BioCro repository, the raw data is rounded to three
significant digits. This can be done with the following code: <code>
  soybean_weather &lt;- lapply(raw_soybean_weather, function(wd) { for (cn in colnames(wd)) { wd[[cn]] &lt;- signif(wd[[cn]], digits = 3) }; wd })
  </code>
