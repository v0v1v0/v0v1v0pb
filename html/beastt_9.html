<h2>Internal Binary Data for Propensity Score Balancing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simulated dataset used to illustrate Bayesian dynamic borrowing in
the case when borrowing from an external control arm with a binary endpoint,
where the baseline covariate distributions of the internal and external data
are balanced via inverse probability weighting.
</p>
