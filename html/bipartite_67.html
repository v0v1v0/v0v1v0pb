<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For explanations of any of the indices computed for a level (i.e. those with HL and/or LL suffix), please see <code>grouplevel</code> for details.
</p>
<p>This function implements a variety of the many (and still procreating) indices describing network topography. Some are embarrassingly simple and mere descriptors of a network's outer appearance (such as number of species in each trophic level or the number of links (= non-zero cells) in the web). Others are variations on Shannon's diversity index applied to within column or within rows. Only extinction slope is newly implemented here, and hence described in a bit more detail.
</p>
<p>Currently, you <em>cannot</em> get the <em>qualitative</em> version of quantitative indices such as vulnerability!
</p>
<p>Integers or continuous values - what are the quantities in quantitative webs? Some web metrics expect in their typical formulation that the entries in the web-matrix are integers - e.g. H2' is defined relative to minimum and maximum based on marginal totals. Blüthgen et al. (2006) use an algorithm assuming values can only be integers. If your quantities are not constrained to be integers, multiplication and rounding may or may not give consistent results, depending on rounding errors and the factor applied. Multiplication with high numbers such as 10 000 seems to be OK. For H2' a simplified calculation applicable to continuous numbers is available (by declaring option <span class="option">H2_integer=FALSE</span> in <code>H2fun</code>). Note that values of H2' based on integers are not directly comparable to H2' based on continuous values (for sparse webs, H2'_continuous is much higher than H2'_integer). We tentatively think that other indices are hardly affected by non-integer values or by multiplication and rounding. Please let us know your experience.

Positive values (only possible of <span class="option">ISAmethod = "Bluethgen"</span>) indicate higher dependence in the higher trophic level. See function <code>specieslevel</code> and its index <span class="option">interaction push/pull</span>, which quantifies the balance of affecting and being effected by other species. Similarly, index <span class="option">strength</span> quantifies the average effect of each species on all its partners.</p>

<td><code>specialisation asymmetry</code></td>
<td>
<p>(selected by using <span class="option">index="SA"</span>). Asymmetry (higher vs. lower trophic level) of specialisation now based on d' (see <code>dfun</code>), which is insensitive to the dimensions of the web. Again, two options of calculation are available: the one proposed by Blüthgen et al. (2007), where they weight the specialisation value for each species by its abundance (<span class="option">SAmethod="Bluethgen"</span>) or where d'-values are log-transformed (arguing that d'-values are indeed log-normally distributed: <span class="option">SAmethod="log"</span>). Since the mean d-value for the lower trophic level is subtracted from that of the higher, positive values indicate a higher specialisation of the higher trophic level.</p>

<p>Shannon's evenness for the web entries. Note that the two options are rather different. By definition, IE = H/Hmax; H = -sum(p.i.mat*log(p.i.mat)), where p.i.mat = matrix/sum(entries in matrix). This means, when calculating H, do we treat all possible links as species, and the interactions (cell values) as measure of their abundance? By definition, Hmax = ln(N). The key question is: What is the right value for N? Since we treat the matrix cells as species, it is (clearly?) the number of matrix cells, i.e. number of higher trophic level species x number of lower trophic level species. We think this logic justifies our default <code>"prod"</code>. However, others argue in favour of N=number of links. Please see note for our discussion on this point.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p><b>Sum or Prod: How to calculate interaction evenness?</b> I shall first put down my argument for “prod” and then Jason Tylianakis' arguments for “sum”. 
</p>
<p>Carsten: “I do not want to defend a position I cannot hold against the flood of qualified criticism, and shall be happy to change the default to option “sum” (i.e. Jason's proposal). Nevertheless, I shall make a very brief attempt to defend my (and Nico's point of view). Imagine a completely different situation: I have “counted” birds in a landscape. From a more meticulous colleague I know that there are 27 bird species breeding at the moment, but on that two mornings that I went out, I could only hear 15. Now I want to calculate the Shannon diversity (and evenness) of birds in that landscape. The “normal” (in the sense of established) approach to use the data from my 15 species. But hold on: I KNOW there are more species out there. I don't know how many (i.e. there may be more than the 27 my colleague has found), but there are at least 27. If I only use the data from my 15 species, I will get a higher evenness value than when I also include the 12 zeros. My conclusion would be: I don't want to overestimate evenness only because I couldn't look long enough, thus I use all 27 values.”
</p>
<p>Jason: “I would disagree because what you “know” is based on your meticulous colleague's ‘sampling’, which will also have its limits. If all you wanted was to know the total number of species there (assuming none have gone extinct), then what you propose is fine. However, the problem comes when you want to compare sites, and then sampling effort should be standardised. In most cases we know we don't have a full representation of the diversity (or food web) of an area, but we know for a given spatial or temporal sampling scale that one site differs from another in certain ways, and to me that is the most important. Anyway, it is all a question of scale and the precise question being asked. So what about making it an option in bipartite that you can either choose to divide by the realised links (give our 2007 paper as a ref, so people know it's comparable to that) or divide by the number of potential links, if that's the question people want to ask?”
There you go: it's your choice!
</p>
<p><b>NA values:</b>
All error and warning messages are (or at least should be) suppressed! If your web returns and NA for some of the indices, this can be because the index cannot be computed. For example, if the web is full (i.e. no 0-cells), extinction slopes cannot be fitted (singularity of gradient). Check if you can expect the index to be computable! If it is, and networklevel doesn't do it, let me know.
</p>
<p><b>Reducing computation time:</b>
Some indices require rather long computation times on large webs. If you want to increase the speed by omitting some indices, here a rough guide: Ask only for the indices you are interested in! Otherwise, here is the sequence of most time-consuming indices: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The slowest function is related to extinction slopes and robustness. Excluding both makes the function faster.

<li> <p><span class="option">weighted cluster coefficient</span> is also very time consuming (an exhaustive search for 4-loops in the one-mode projection of the network). Omitting it can dramatically boost speed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Degree distributions are somewhat time consuming. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Fisher's alpha is computed iteratively and hence time consuming. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Nestedness and weighted nestedness are not the fastest of routines. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Number (and diversity) of compartments calls a recursive and hence relatively slow algorithm. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> H2 and specialisation asymmetry require an iterative, heuristic search algorithm. Finally, excluding discrepancy can also moderately decrease computation time.

<p><b>Does the species sequence in the data matter?</b>
Obviously, it shouldn't, and for most indices it doesn't. However, particularly indices based on binary representation of <span class="option">web</span> will have ties, where several species have the number of links. In this case, it does matter how the matrix is sorted before simulating extinctions or computing discrepancy. There is no (known) foolproof way to get this sequence "right" (see also "Details" of help for <code>nesteddisc</code>). Re-running the same code with a shuffled network may thus yield (slightly) different values for (weighted) nestedness, togetherness, discrepancy, extinction slopes and robustness. (Thanks to Valentin Stefan for making us explicitly addressing this issue!)
