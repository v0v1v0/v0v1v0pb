<h2>Reshape a webarray to a web X link matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to turn an array with sites as third dimension into a web by link matrix (e.g. sites X links). This is the "link community matrix" to use for dissimilarity calculations. Mostly just a helper function for <code>betalinkr</code>. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">array2linkmx(webarray)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>webarray</code></td>
<td>
<p>An array of two or more networks. Assumes the third dimension is the webID in the array, which will become the first dimension in the link-matrix (output).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function converts the two-dimensional adjacency matrices (i.e., bipartite webs) to one-dimensional vectors (similar to what network people call “edgelists”). These vectors become rows of a matrix (which has one row per web). This makes the data available to community ecology methods, e.g. those offered by the <code>vegan</code> package. Links are treated equivalently to species in a “normal” community analysis (note that it makes no difference whether one or both partner of an interaction differ, in both cases the link has a different identity). The function is used here mostly as a helper for interaction dissimilarity calculations with <code>betalinkr</code>.
</p>
<p><code>dimnames</code> are optional but recommended for the webarray. Names of the third dimension will become rownames in the output. Colnames (i.e. names of links) will be created from dimnames[[1]] (“lower species”) and dimnames[[2]] (“higher species”), separated by “__” (double underscore).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with one row per web and one column per link (i.e. per combination of lower and higher species). All-zero columns may often be included.</p>
