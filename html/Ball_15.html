<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Male and female macaque skull data. 7 landmarks in 3 dimensions, 
18 individuals (9 males, 9 females)

<h3>Format</h3>


<p><code>macaques$x</code>: An array of dimension <code class="reqn">7 \times 3 \times 18</code>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In an investigation into sex differences in the crania of a species of 
Macaca fascicularis (a type of monkey), random samples of 9 male and 9 female 
skulls were obtained by Paul Oâ€™Higgins (Hull-York Medical School) (Dryden and Mardia 1993). 
A subset of seven anatomical landmarks was located on each cranium and the three-dimensional (3D) 
coordinates of each point were recorded.
