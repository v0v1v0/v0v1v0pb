<h2>Various functions for modifying fields of view objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions allow for direct replacement of fields of view objects such as the pick
matrix and vector of confidences.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">PMatrix(views) &lt;- value
confidences(views) &lt;- value
qv(views) &lt;- value
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>views</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class BLViews or COPViews, except in the case of qv&lt;- which applies only to BLViews</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>value</code></td>
<td>
<p> A vector in <code>confidences&lt;-</code> and <code>qv&lt;-</code> or a matrix in <code>PMatrix&lt;-</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The object is modified directly
