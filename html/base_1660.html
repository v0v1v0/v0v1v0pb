<h2>Write Lines to a Connection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Write text lines to a connection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">writeLines(text, con = stdout(), sep = "\n", useBytes = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code id="text">text</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="con">con</code></td>
<td>
<p>a connection object or a character string.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="sep">sep</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string.  A string to be written to the connection
after each line of text.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="useBytes">useBytes</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  See ‘Details’.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the <code>con</code> is a character string, the function calls
<code>file</code> to obtain a file connection which is opened for
the duration of the function call.
(tilde expansion of the file path is done by <code>file</code>.)
</p>
<p>If the connection is open it is written from its current position.
If it is not open, it is opened for the duration of the call in
<code>"wt"</code> mode and then closed again.
</p>
<p>Normally <code>writeLines</code> is used with a text-mode  connection, and the
default separator is converted to the normal separator for that
platform (<abbr>LF</abbr> on Unix/Linux, <abbr>CRLF</abbr> on Windows).  For more
control, open 
a binary connection and specify the precise value you want written to
the file in <code>sep</code>.  For even more control, use
<code>writeChar</code> on a binary connection.
</p>
<p><code>useBytes</code> is for expert use.  Normally (when false) character
strings with marked encodings are converted to the current encoding
before being passed to the connection (which might do further
re-encoding).  <code>useBytes = TRUE</code> suppresses the re-encoding of
marked strings so they are passed byte-by-byte to the connection:
this can be useful when strings have already been re-encoded by
e.g. <code>iconv</code>.  (It is invoked automatically for strings
with marked encoding <code>"bytes"</code>.)
