<h2>I/O: Only used within Rcpp</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This workaround for parsing cubes was neccessary at development time
because there was a (presumable) bug in RcppArmadillo that sometimes
caused the parsing of arma::cx_cube objects to fail, such that the function
received an un-initialized object instead of the parsed one.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cx_cube_from_ComplexVector(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The workaround parses an Rcpp vector instead, and manually
copies the data in an arma::cx_cube object.
Besides being redundant, it also makes the code less readable and it is
hoped that this workaround can be removed in future revisions.
