<h2>Construct and fit as complete a model as possible and perform stepwise elimination</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>buildmer</code> package consists of a number of functions, each designed to fit specific types of models (e.g. <code>buildmer</code> for mixed-effects regression, <code>buildgam</code> for generalized additive models, <code>buildmertree</code> for mixed-effects-regression trees, and so forth). The common parameters shared by all (or most of) these functions are documented here. If you are looking for a more general description of what the various <code>build...</code> functions do, see under ‘Details’. For function-specific details, see the documentation for each individual function.
