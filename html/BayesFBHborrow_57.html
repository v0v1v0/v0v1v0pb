<h2>Example data, simulated from a Weibull distribution.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data is simulated for a concurrent trial with three columns named "tte" 
(time-to-event), "event" (event indicator), and "X_trt" (treatment indicator).
It was simulated by drawing samples from a Weibull with kappa = 1.5 (shape) 
and nu = 0.4 (scale)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(weibull_cc)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 250 rows and 3 columns.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(weibull_cc)
survival_model &lt;- survival::survfit(survival::Surv(tte, event) ~ X_trt, data = weibull_cc)
line_colors &lt;- c("blue", "red")  # Adjust colors as needed
line_types &lt;- 1:length(unique(weibull_cc$X_trt))
plot(survival_model, col = line_colors, lty = line_types, 
     xlab = "Time (tte)", ylab = "Survival Probability", 
     main = "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves by Treatment")
</code></pre>
