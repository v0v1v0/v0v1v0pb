Bivariate Pareto Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perform competing risks analysis under bivariate Pareto models. See Shih et al. (2018) for details.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions in this package are based on latent failure time models with competing risks in Shih et al. (2018). However, they can be adapted to dependent censoring models in Emura and Chen (2018). See <code>MLE.SN.Pareto</code> for example.
