<h2>GPP-based Growing Season Filter</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filters annual time series for growing season based on smoothed daily GPP data.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The basic idea behind the growing season filter is that vegetation is 
considered to be active when its carbon uptake (GPP) is above a specified 
threshold, which is defined relative to the peak GPP (95th percentile) 
observed in the year. 
The GPP-threshold is calculated as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">GPP_threshold = quantile(GPPd,0.95)*tGPP</code>
</p>

<p>GPPd time series are smoothed with a moving average to avoid fluctuations 
in the delineation of the growing season. The window size defaults to 15 
days, but depending on the ecosystem, other values can be appropriate. 
</p>
<p>The argument <code>min.int</code> serves to avoid short fluctuations in the 
status growing season vs. no growing season by defining a minimum length
of the status. If a time interval shorter than <code>min.int</code> is labeled
as growing season or non-growing season, it is changed to the status of 
the neighboring values.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector of type integer of the same length as the input GPPd in which 0 indicate
no growing season (dormant season) and 1 indicate growing season.
