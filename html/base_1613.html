<h2>Delete Files and Directories</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>unlink</code> deletes the file(s) or directories specified by <code>x</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">unlink(x, recursive = FALSE, force = FALSE, expand = TRUE)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector with the names of the file(s) or
directories to be deleted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="recursive">recursive</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  Should directories be deleted recursively?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="force">force</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  Should permissions be changed (if possible) to
allow the file or directory to be removed?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="expand">expand</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Should wildcards (see ‘Details’ below) and
tilde (see <code>path.expand</code>) be expanded?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>recursive = FALSE</code> directories are not deleted,
not even empty ones.
</p>
<p>On most platforms ‘file’ includes symbolic links, fifos and
sockets.  <code>unlink(x, recursive = TRUE)</code>
deletes just the symbolic link if the target of such a link is a directory.
</p>
<p>Wildcard expansion (normally ‘<span class="file">*</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">?</span>’ are allowed) is done by
the internal code of <code>Sys.glob</code>.  Wildcards never match a
leading ‘<span class="file">.</span>’ in the filename, and files ‘<span class="file">.</span>’, ‘<span class="file">..</span>’ and
‘<span class="file">~</span>’ will never be considered for deletion.
Wildcards will only be expanded if the system supports it.  Most
systems will support not only ‘<span class="file">*</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">?</span>’ but also character
classes such as ‘<span class="file">[a-z]</span>’ (see the <code>man</code> pages for the system
call <code>glob</code> on your OS).  The metacharacters <code>* ? [</code> can
occur in Unix filenames, and this makes it difficult to use
<code>unlink</code> to delete such files (see <code>file.remove</code>),
although escaping the metacharacters by backslashes usually works.  If
a metacharacter matches nothing it is considered as a literal
character.
</p>
<p><code>recursive = TRUE</code> might not be supported on all platforms, when it
will be ignored, with a warning: however there are no known current
examples.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>0</code> for success, <code>1</code> for failure, invisibly.
Not deleting a non-existent file is not a failure, nor is being unable
to delete a directory if <code>recursive = FALSE</code>.  However, missing
values in <code>x</code> are regarded as failures.
