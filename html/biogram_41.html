<h2>Human signal peptides cleavage sites</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of 648 cleavage sites and 648 parts of mature proteins shortly after cleavage sites 
derived from human proteome.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1296 observations on the following 10 variables. Columns from
<code>P1</code> to <code>P9</code> describes positions in an extracted peptide. <code>tar</code> is a target vector. It
has value 1 if a peptide is a cleavage site and 0 if not.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each peptide in the data set is nine amino acid residues long. In case of cleavage sites,
the clevage is located between fifth and sixth peptide.
The non-cleavage sites are parts of mature proteins starting five positions after cleavage site.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Amino acid residues were recoded as integers.
