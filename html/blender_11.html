<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set includes county-level occupancy for native and exotic plants
in 47 US states
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(PLANTS)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>List</code> containing a <code>data.frame</code> for the native species in
each state and a second <code>data.frame</code> for
the exotic species in each state.  Each data frame is organized with
counties as columns and species as rows.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Per the USDA PLANTS Database website,
species were listed as "native" if their L48 native status was listed
as N, N?, NI, or NI? and "exotic" if their L48 native status was listed
as GP, GP?, I, I?, N?I, W, or W?.  See http://plants.usda.gov/about_adv_search.html
for descriptions of these terms.
</p>
<p>The USDA PLANTS Database does not include county-level data on Alaska
or Maryland.  Hawaii was excluded from this data set because L48 native
status did not apply to it.
