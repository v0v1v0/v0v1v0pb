<h2>consequenceCovid Bayesian Network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Global sensitivity analysis of uncertain parameters in Bayesian networks.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A discrete Bayesian network including demographic information of the respondents of the Eurobarometer 93.1 together with their opinion about how the COVID-19 emergency was handled by local authorities and its consequences in the long term. The Bayesian network was learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
