<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the area below the extinction curve generated by <code>second.extinct</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">robustness(object)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of type class <code>bipartite</code>, usually generated by <code>second.extinct</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates the area below the extinction curve generated by second.extinct as a measure of the robustness of the system to the loss of species.
</p>
<p>The curve, first proposed by Memmott et al. (2004), is based on the fact that if a given fraction of species of one guild (for instance, the pollinators) are eliminated, a number of species of the other guild (e.g. plants) which depend on their interactions become extinct. The slope and general shape of the curve provided a straightforward graphic description of the tolerance of a system to the extinction of its component species.
</p>
<p>An improvement of Memmott et al.'s curve was developed by Burgos et al. (2007) by introducing a quantitative measure of robustness with a single parameter R, defined as the area under the extinction curve. It is intuitive that R = 1 corresponds to a curve that decreases very mildly until the point at which almost all animal species are eliminated. This is consistent with a very robust system in which, for instance, most of the plant species survive even if a large fraction of the animal species is eliminated. Conversely R = 0 corresponds to an ATC that decreases abruptly as soon as any species is lost. This is consistent with a fragile system in which, for instance, even if a very small fraction of the animal species is eliminated, most of the plants loose all their interactions and go extinct.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the robustness of the web to the removal of species.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This index complements the information given by <code>slope.bipartite</code>, although it has the advantage of not being constrained by the shape of the particular curve (concave or convex).
