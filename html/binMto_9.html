<h2> Sample size iteration for many-to-one comparisons of binomials </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function iteratively increases sample size until a pre-specified any-pair power of a test is achieved. 
Here, only power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between treatment and control ( H0[i]: p[i] - p[0]=0 ) is covered .
Approximative calculation of power is used, the ratio of sample size to the control group to the treatment 
groups can be specified.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nbinMto(Ntotal = 500, pH1, ratio = 1, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8,
 alternative = "two.sided", method = "Add4", trace = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ntotal</code></td>
<td>
<p> a single number or vector with two integers specifying the maximum or the range of total sample size allowed in iteration </p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pH1</code></td>
<td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function uses approximative calculation of any-pair-power of a maximum test as described in Bretz and Hothorn (2002) for a
Wald test of multiple contrasts of binary data. Differing from Bretz and Hothorn (2002), unpooled variance estimators are used in the
present function. In case of "Add4" and "Add2"-method, the Wald expectation and variance are replaced by that of add-4 and add-2.
Since the approximate calculation assumes normality, this function can give misleading results, if sample size is small and/or proportions
of success are extreme. 
The present function only calcualtes power for the test adjusting via the multivariate-normal-distribution.
For Bonferroni-adjusted or unadjusted tests, one can make use of well-known formulas for power and sample size for binary data.
</p>
<p>The use of the function simPower in this package will result in power estimation closer to the true performance of the methods but is less convenient.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix containing in columns: n of the single groups, the total n, the approximative any-pair-power.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

  
<p>The results of this functions are roughly checked by comparison with results of power simualtion, which indicate that the approximations are reasonable for
at least moderate n and not too extreme proportions.
The performance of a corresponding test using the add-4 or add-2 adjustment is not described.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Iterate the sample size necessary to achieve
# a power of 80% to reject the null of no treatment
# effects in a dose-response trial for comparing 
# four doses with placebo. The assumed proportions
# of success are 0.45 for the placebo,
# and 0.45, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6  for the increasing doses.
# Assume that only an increase of response is of interest:
# alternative="greater"

# a) use a balanced design: ratio=1

nbinMto(Ntotal = c(800, 1200), pH1=c(0.45, 0.45, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6),
 ratio = 1, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, 
 alternative = "greater", method = "Wald", trace = FALSE)

# Compare with the results in Bretz and Hothorn (2002),
# Table III. Note, that in the present function unpooled
# variance estimators are used, while Bretz and Hothorn use 
# a pooled variance estimator.
# Note further, that there is some Monte Carlo Error in computing
# multivariate normal probabilities.
