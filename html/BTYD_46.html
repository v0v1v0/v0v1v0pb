<h2>CDNOW repeat transaction data summary</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data representing the purchasing behavior of 2,357 CDNOW customers between
January 1997 and June 1998, summarized as a customer-by-time matrix and a
vector of cumulative weekly transactions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(cdnowSummary)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A named list of four elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>cbs</code>  A customer-by-time matrix with four columns: frequency ("x"), recency
("t.x"), length of observation in the calibration period ("T.cal"), and
number of transactions in the holdout period ("x.star"). Each row represents
a customer.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cu.tracking</code>  A vector containing cumulative transactions for
every week in both the calibration and estimating periods (78 weeks total).
This vector contains the sum of transactions across all customers.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>est.params</code>   A vector containing estimated values for the four Pareto/NBD
parameters: r, alpha, s, and beta, in that order. This estimation was made
using <code>pnbd.EstimateParameters</code>, and is included here to avoid having to
run the relatively time-consuming parameter estimation function in examples.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>m.x</code>  A vector containing the average value of each customer's repeat
transactions. Used in examples for spend functions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The customers in this data represent 1/10th of the cohort of customers who
made their first transactions with CDNOW in the first quarter of 1997. CDNOW
was an online retailer, selling music and related products on the web since
1994.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data was put together using data conversion functions included in
this package. The original event log is included (see <code>cdnowElog</code>).
