<h2>Saturna Island wind directions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset consisting of 239 observations on wind direction in radians (original measurements were
in 10s of degrees), measured at Saturna Island, British Columbia,
Canada during October 1-10, 2016 (obtained from Environment Canada website). There was a severe storm
during October 4-7, which caused significant fluctuations among the wind directions. As a result the
angular data show a clear multimodality.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(wind)

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 239 rows and 2 columns; the column "angle" provides the angular direction (in radian)
and the column day provides the days on which the data points were collected (ranges between 1-10, corresponding to
October 1-10, 2016).
