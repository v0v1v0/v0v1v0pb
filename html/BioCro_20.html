<h2>Miscanthus model definition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Initial values, parameters, direct modules, differential modules, and
a differential equation solver that can be used to run
<em>Miscanthus x giganteus</em> growth simulations in Champaign, Illinois and
other locations.
</p>
<p>To represent <em>Miscanthus</em> growth in Champaign, IL, these values must be
paired with the Champaign weather data (<code>cmi_weather_data</code>). The
parameters already include the <code>clay_loam</code> values from the
<code>soil_parameters</code> dataset, which is the appropriate soil type for
Champaign.
</p>
<p>Some specifications, such as the values of photosynthetic parameters, would
remain the same in any location; others, such as the latitude or longitude,
would need to change when simulating crop growth in different locations. Care
must be taken to understand each input quantity before attempting to run
simulations in other places or for other cultivars.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of 5 named elements that are suitable for passing to
<code>run_biocro</code>, as described in the help page for
<code>crop_model_definitions</code>.

<p>This model was originally described in Miguez <em>et al.</em> (2009)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1757-1707.2009.01019.x">doi:10.1111/j.1757-1707.2009.01019.x</a>] and Miguez <em>et al.</em> (2012)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01150.x">doi:10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01150.x</a>]. Since its original parameterization,
the behavior of several of its core modules has changed as bugs have been
identified and fixed, so this model likely needs to be reparameterized before
it can be used for realistic simulations.
