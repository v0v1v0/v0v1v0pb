<h2>
Semiannual (Dis)Aggregation
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns a semi-annual (dis)aggregated time series, by using as input an annual, quarterly, monthly or daily time series.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SEMIANNUAL(x = NULL, fun = NULL, avoidCompliance = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>Input time series that must satisfy the compliance control check defined in <code>is.bimets</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fun</code></td>
<td>
<p> Only for daily or monthly or quarterly input time series:<br><b>STOCK</b>: the value of the input time series in the last observation of a half-year is assigned to the same half-year of the output time series.<br><b>NSTOCK</b>: the value of the input time series in the last non-missing observation of a half-year is assigned to the same half-year of the output time series.<br><b>SUM</b>: the sum of input observations in a half-year is assigned to the same half-year of the output time series.<br><b>NSUM</b>:  the sum of input non-missing observations in a half-year is assigned to the same half-year of the output time series. <br><b>AVE</b>: the average of input observations in a half-year is assigned to the same half-year of the output time series. <br><b>NAVE</b>: the average of input non-missing observations in a half-year is assigned to the same half-year of the output time series.<br><br>
Only for annual input time series:<br><b>NULL</b>: (default) the output value of each half-year observation is set equal to the value of the input observation the half-year belongs to (i.e. duplicated values over the period)<br><b>INTERP_END</b>: the value of the input time series in a period is copied into the last half-year of the output time series that lies in the same period. Other values are calculated by linear interpolation.<br><b>INTERP_CENTER</b>: the value of the input time series in a period is copied into the median half-year of the output time series that lies in the same period. Other values are calculated by linear interpolation. <br><b>INTERP_BEGIN</b>: the value of the input time series in a period is copied into the first half-year of the output time series that lies in the same period. Other values are calculated by linear interpolation.
