<h2>Signal Tandmobiel data, version Roos</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the dataset resulting from a longitudinal prospective dental
study performed in Flanders (North of Belgium) in 1996 – 2001. The
cohort of 4\,468 randomly sampled children who attended the first year
of the basic school at the beginning of the study was annualy dental
examined by one of 16 trained dentists.
The original dataset consists thus of at most 6 dental observations
for each child.
</p>
<p>The dataset presented here contains mainly the
information on the emergence and caries times summarized in the
interval-censored observations. Some baseline covariates are also
included here.
</p>
<p>For more detail on the design of the study see Vanobbergen et
al. (2000).
</p>
<p>This is the version of the dataset used first by Leroy et al. (2005)
and contains a subset of the <code>tandmob2</code>. Some children
were removed to satisfy inclusion criteria given in Leroy et
al. (2005). Additionally, left-censored emergence times of the
permanent first molars are adjusted according to the eruption stage
(see Leroy et al., 2005).
</p>
<p>This data set was then used in the analyses presented in
Komárek and Lesaffre (2006, 2008).
</p>

<dt>GIRL</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, 0 = <em>boy</em>, 1 = <em>girl</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>EBEG.xx</dt>
<dd>
<p>lower limit of the emergence (in years of age) of the
permanent tooth xx. In contrast to <code>tandmob2</code>, the lower
emergence limit for the permanent first molars that were originally
left-censored, are adjusted according to the eruption stage (see
Leroy, 2005 for more details).
</p>
<p>xx takes values 16, 26, 36, 46 (permanent first molars).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>EEND.xx</dt>
<dd>
<p>upper limit of the emergence (in years of age) of the
permanent tooth xx. <code>NA</code> if the emergence was right-censored.
</p>
<p>xx takes values as for the variable <code>EBEG.xx</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>FBEG.xx</dt>
<dd>
<p>lower limit for the caries time (in years of age, ‘F’
stands for ‘failure’) of the permanent tooth xx. <code>NA</code> if the
caries time was left-censored.
</p>
<p>xx takes values as for the variable <code>EBEG.xx</code>.    
</p>
</dd>
<dt>FEND.xx</dt>
<dd>
<p>upper limit for the caries time (in years of age, ‘F’
stands for ‘failure’) of the permanent tooth xx. <code>NA</code> if the
caries time was right-censored.
</p>
<p>xx takes values as for the variable <code>EBEG.xx</code>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for all teeth except 16, 26, 36 and 46 almost all
the caries times are right-censored. For teeth 16, 26, 36, 46, the
amount of right-censoring is only about 25%.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>TOOTH.xx</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, 0 or 1. Equal to 1 if the information
concerning the permanent tooth was available, 0 if the permanent
tooth xx was removed from the dataset by Kris.
</p>
<p>xx takes values 16, 26, 36, 46.
</p>
<p>These variables are almost useless for ordinary users.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Txxd</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, 0 or 1. It is equal to 1 if the deciduous tooth
xx was decayed, 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>xx takes values 54, 64, 74, 84 (deciduous first molars),
55, 65, 75, 85 (deciduous second molars).
</p>

xx was filled, 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>xx takes values 54, 64, 74, 84 (deciduous first molars),
55, 65, 75, 85 (deciduous second molars).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Txxs</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, 0 or 1. It is equal to 1 if the deciduous tooth

</p>
<p>xx takes values 54, 64, 74, 84 (deciduous first molars),
55, 65, 75, 85 (deciduous second molars).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>SEAL.xx</dt>

first molar xx was sealed in pits and fissures (a form of
protection), 0 otherwise.

</p>
</dd>
<dt>FREQ.BR</dt>
<dd>

daily the teeth, equal to 0 if he/she brushes less than once a day.

</p>
<p>xx takes values 16, 26, 36, 46 (permanent first molars).    
</p>
</dd>  
<dt>PLAQUE.xx.2</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, 0 or 1. It is equal to 1 if there was
occlusal plaque on the total occlusal surface of the permanent tooth xx. It
is equal to 0 if there was either no plaque present or the plaque
was present only in pits and fissures.
</p>
<p>xx takes values 16, 26, 36, 46 (permanent first molars).
