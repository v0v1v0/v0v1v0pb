<h2>Test for Azoic Samples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Case-insensitive test for taxa starting with 'azoi'
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">is_azoic(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector containing taxa</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Azoic samples need special attention during data analysis. 
They should be marked as 'azoic', and taken care of during
analysis. Note that an azoic sample is not the same as a
record where a taxon has zero counts. The latter should be
removed from further analysis, whereas the former provides
important information.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>logical vector, with elements <code>TRUE</code> for azoic samples, 
and <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.
