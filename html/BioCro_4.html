<h2>Miscanthus dry biomass data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The first column is the thermal time. The second, third, fourth, and fifth
columns are miscanthus stem, leaf, root, and rhizome dry biomass in Mg
ha<sup>-1</sup> (root is missing). The sixth column is the leaf area index.
The <code>annualDB.c</code> version is altered so that root biomass is not
missing and LAI is smaller. The purpose of this last modification is for
testing some functions.
