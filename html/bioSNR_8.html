<h2>wavelength and frequency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function finds the length of a sound wave, known as the wavelength (m), or
frequency of a sound (Hz), given the identity of the input. The speed of sound is the default in
air (340 m/s). You may calculate your own value for c relative to the conditions present
in your ecosystem of study via soundSpeed().
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wof(b, c = 340)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>The known wavelength (m) or frequency (Hz).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>c</code></td>
<td>
<p>The speed of sound in m/s. As a general rule of thumb, however, c is equal to 1500 m/s in saltwater and 350 m/s in air. Note that the distinction between freshwater and saltwater is important. Sound speed is faster in saltwater than freshwater.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The unknown wavelength (m) or frequency (Hz) given the identity of input a.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Given a frequency of 80 Hz in air, what is the wavelength?
wof(80000)
# Given a wavelength of 0.004 m in salt water, what is the frequency?
wof(0.004, c=1500)
