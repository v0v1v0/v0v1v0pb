<h2>suitSplit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides the probabilities with with a number of cards  will split between two hands, given a number of unknown cards in each hand.
Unknown hands are assumed to be West and East.
</p>
<p>If there is no information to indicate different numbers of unknown cards in both hands, then symmetrical probabilities will be returned.
However, if one hand is expected to have a different number of cards to the other, then these can be specified.  For example, if during the
bidding East overcalled in spades, indicating a 5 card suit, then when looking at hearts, East has fewer cards.  While the number of assumed
cards in West's hand is 13 ('cards_W = 13'), the assumed cards in East should be reduced to 8 ('cards_E = 8')
</p>
