<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Body measurements for 143 wild bears.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 143 observations on the following 12 variables.
</p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p>ID. Indentification number
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Age. Bear's age, in months. Note, wild bears are always born
in January, so an expert can estimate the bear's age without directly asking
it how old it is.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Month. Month when the measurement was
made. 1 = Jan., 12 = Dec. Since bears hibernate in the winter, their body
shape probably depends on the season.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sex. 1 = male 2 =
female  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Head.L. Length of the head, in inches 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Head.W. Width of the head, in inches 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neck.G. Girth (distance around) the neck, in inches 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Length. Body length, in inches  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chest.G. Girth
(distance around) the chest, in inches  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight. Weight of the
bear, in pounds  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obs.No. Observation number for this bear.
For example, the bear with ID = 41 (Bertha) was measured on four occasions,
in the months coded 7, 8, 11, and 5. The value of Obs.No goes from 1 to 4
for these observations.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name. The names of the bears given
to them by the researchers </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Wild bears were anesthetized, and their bodies were measured and weighed.
One goal of the study was to make a table (or perhaps a set of tables) for
hunters, so they could estimate the weight of a bear based on other
measurements. This would be used because in the forest it is easier to
measure the length of a bear, for example, than it is to weigh it.
