<h2>Lung cancer genomic data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Publicly available lung cancer genomic data from the Chemores Cohort Study, containing 
the expression levels of mRNA, miRNA, artificial noise variables as well as clinical variables and response.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>


<p><code>genlung$survival</code>: A data.frame containing <code class="reqn">n=123</code> complete observations. 
The first column is disease-free survival time and the 
second column is censoring status. 
</p>
<p><code>genlung$covariate</code>: A data.frame containing <code class="reqn">p=2000</code> covariates.

</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Tissue samples were analysed from a cohort of 123 patients, who underwent complete surgical resection at the Institut Mutualiste
Montsouris (Paris, France) between 30 January 2002 and 26 June 2006. The studied outcome was the "Disease-Free Survival Time".
Patients were followed until the first relapse occurred or administrative censoring. In this genomic dataset, 
the expression levels of Agilent miRNA probes (<code class="reqn">p=939</code>) were included from the <code class="reqn">n=123</code> cohort samples. 
The miRNA data contains normalized expression levels. See below the paper by Lazar et al. (2013) and Array Express 
data repository for the complete description of the samples, tissue preparation, Agilent array technology, and data normalization. 
In addition to the genomic data, five clinical variables, also evaluated on the cohort samples, are included as 
continuous variable ('Age') and nominal variables ('Type','KRAS.status','EGFR.status','P53.status'). 
See Lazar et al. (2013) for more details. Moreover, we add 1056 standard gaussian variables 
which are independent with the censored response as noise covariates. This dataset represents a situation where the number of 
covariates dominates the number of complete observations or <code class="reqn">p &gt;&gt; n</code> case.
