<h2>Install Hugo</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Download the appropriate Hugo executable for your platform from Github and
try to copy it to a system directory so <span class="pkg">blogdown</span> can run the
<code>hugo</code> command to build a site.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">install_hugo(
  version = "latest",
  extended = TRUE,
  arch = "auto",
  os = "auto",
  force = FALSE,
  ...
)

update_hugo()
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>version</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Hugo version number, e.g., <code>0.26</code>; the special value
<code>latest</code> means the latest version (fetched from Github releases).
Alternatively, this argument can take a file path of the zip archive or
tarball of the Hugo installer that has already been downloaded from Github,
in which case it will not be downloaded again.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extended</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to use extended version of Hugo that has SCSS/SASS
support. You only need the extended version if you want to edit SCSS/SASS.
Note that this feature is not available to Hugo version lower than v0.43.
It also requires a 64-bit system; if the system is based on the ARM
architecture, only macOS is supported at the moment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arch, os</code></td>
<td>
<p>The architecture and operating system name. These arguments,
along with <code>version</code> and <code>extended</code>, determines the filename of
the Hugo installer. See <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases">https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases</a> for
all of Hugo's installers. By default, the argument values are automatically
detected. In case the detection should fail, you can provide the values
manually, e.g., <code>extended = FALSE</code>, <code>arch = 'ARM64'</code>, and
<code>os = 'FreeBSD'</code> would install ‘<span class="file">hugo_*_FreeBSD-ARM.tar.gz</span>’.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to reinstall Hugo if the specified version has been
installed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ignored.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function tries to install Hugo to <code>Sys.getenv('APPDATA')</code> on
Windows, ‘<span class="file">~/Library/Application Support</span>’ on macOS, and
‘<span class="file">~/.local/share</span>’ on other platforms (such as Linux). The <code>hugo</code>
executable is installed to a subdirectory with the Hugo version number being
its name, e.g., ‘<span class="file">~/Library/Application Support/Hugo/0.76.5</span>’. If these
directories are not writable, the R package directory ‘<span class="file">Hugo</span>’ of
<span class="pkg">blogdown</span> will be used. If it still fails, you have to install Hugo by
yourself and make sure it can be found via the environment variable
<code>PATH</code>.
</p>
<p>This is just a helper function and may fail to choose the correct Hugo
executable for your operating system, especially if you are not on Windows or
macOS or a major Linux distribution. When in doubt, read the Hugo
documentation and install it by yourself: <a href="https://gohugo.io">https://gohugo.io</a>.
</p>
<p>If you want to install Hugo to a custom path, you can set the global option
<code>blogdown.hugo.dir</code> to a directory to store the Hugo executable before
you call <code>install_hugo()</code>, e.g., <code>options(blogdown.hugo.dir =
'~/Downloads/Hugo')</code>. This may be useful for you to use a specific version of
Hugo for a specific website. You can set this option per project. See
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/global-options.html">Section 1.4
Global options</a> for details, or store a copy of Hugo on a USB Flash drive
along with your website.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For macOS users, you are not recommended to install Hugo via Homebrew,
because you may accidentally update it to the latest version, which might
break your existing sites.
