<h2>BRAID Response Surface Combined Potency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates the BRAID index of achievable efficacy (or IAE) for a given
response surface
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">estimateIAE(bpar, levels, limits, lowerLimits = c(0, 0))

## S3 method for class 'braidrm'
estimateIAE(bpar, levels, limits, lowerLimits = c(0, 0))

## S3 method for class 'braidrmflip'
estimateIAE(bpar, levels, limits, lowerLimits = c(0, 0))

## Default S3 method:
estimateIAE(bpar, levels, limits, lowerLimits = c(0, 0))

estimateFlippedIAE(bpar, flip, levels, limits, lowerLimits = c(0, 0))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bpar</code></td>
<td>
<p>The response surface to be evaluated.  Can be a numeric vector
(which will be treated as a standard BRAID parameter vector), a BRAID fit
object of class <code>braidrm</code>, or a flipped BRAID fit object of class
<code>braidrmflip</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>levels</code></td>
<td>
<p>The effect level or levels at which the index is to be
estimated</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>limits</code></td>
<td>
<p>The upper concentration limits beneath which the IAE is to be
estimated.  Could be known toxicity thresholds, limits on pharmacokinetic
availability, or simply a convenient and consistent reference concentration</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lowerLimits</code></td>
<td>
<p>By default, the IAE is calculated by comparing the area
of dose space below which a given effect level is not reached with the total
achievable dose space specified by <code>limits</code>.  However, in some cases, it is
not desirable to allow the sub-threshold area to become infinitesimally
small. If lowerLimits is included, doses that lie below both lower limits
will always be included in the sub-threshold area, placing an effective upper
bound on possible IAE values</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flip</code></td>
<td>
<p>String specifying the direction or directions of the surface's
flip.  Must be one of "A", "B", or "both".</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The index of achievable efficacy is an aggregate measure of combined potency,
and a useful first pass for quantifying the efficacy of a given response
surface.  Formally, it is equal to the area of achievable dose pairs divided
by the area of achievable doses below which a desired effect level is not
reached (then passed through a square root to give a more dimensionless
result).  If the surface is more potent, the area of sub-threshold achievable
doses is smaller, and the IAE is larger.  If the surface is less efficacious,
the doses at which a desired effect is reach will be larger, the
sub-threshold area will increase, and the IAE will decrease.  By default, the
IAE can range from 1 to infinity, but upper bounds can be placed by setting
the values in <code>lowerLimits</code> to concentrations above 0.  For convenience, the
function takes BRAID parameter vectors, <code>braidrm</code> fit objects, and
<code>braidrmflip</code> flipped BRAID fit objects.  However, flipped BRAID response
surface parameters cannot be passed to the function as is, so the function
<code>estimateFlippedIAE</code> is also included specifically for flipped parameter
vectors.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector, the same length as <code>levels</code> with the estimated
index of achievable efficacy (IAE) values for each of those levels.
