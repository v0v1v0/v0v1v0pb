<h2>Create (in)equality constraint matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Parses a character string describing a set of informative hypotheses,
and returns (in)equality constraint matrices
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_matrices(varnames, hyp)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>varnames</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character (vector of characters), containing names of
variables used in the hypotheses.  
which the model parameters are extracted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hyp</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string, containing a hypothesis (see Details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Informative hypotheses specified as a character string by "hyp" should
adhere to the following simple syntax: </p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p> Competing hypotheses
are separated by ";".  Thus, "a=b;a&gt;b" means that H1: a=b, and H2: a&gt;b.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Each individual hypothesis consists of a (series of) (in)equality
constraint(s). Every single (in)equality constraint is of the form "R1*mu1 +
R2*mu2+... = r", where capital Rs refer to numeric scaling constants, must
refer to the names of parameters in the model, and the lower case r refers
to a constant. Standard mathematical simplification rules apply; thus,
"R1*mu1 = R2*mu2" is equivalent to "R1*mu1 - R2*mu2 = 0".  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Multiple
unrelated constraints within one hypothesis can be chained by "&amp;". Thus,
"a=b&amp;c=d" means that H1: a=b AND c=d.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Multiple related constraints
within one hypothesis can be chained by repeating the (in)equality operators
"=", "&lt;", or "&gt;". Thus, "a&lt;b&lt;c" means that H1: a &lt; b AND b &lt; c.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parameters can be grouped by placing them in a parenthesized, comma
separated list. Thus, "(a,b)&gt;c" means that H1: a &gt; c AND b &gt; c.  Similarly,
"(a,b)&gt;(c,d)" means that H1: a &gt; c AND b &gt; c AND b &gt; c AND b &gt; d.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A pair of named matrices for every hypothesis specified in the
<code>hyp</code> argument; one matrix named ERr, specifying equality constraints,
and one matrix named IRr, specifying inequality constraints.
