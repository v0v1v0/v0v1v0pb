<h2>
Plots the acceptance rate of a parameter across MCMC generations
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a plot showing the proportion of proposed moves to accepted moves over the 
duration of the MCMC analysis. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">plot_acceptance_rate(accepted.moves, proposed.moves, param.name =
deparse(substitute(accepted.moves)))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>accepted.moves</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector giving the number of accepted random-walk moves at each sampled MCMC 
generation.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>proposed.moves</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector giving the number of proposed random-walk moves at each sampled MCMC 
generation.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>param.name</code></td>
<td>

<p>The name of the parameter for which the trace plot is being displayed.
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For optimal mixing, between ~20
samplers should be accepted.  If the acceptance rates fall outside that range, this 
function will automatically highlight that parameter as a potential instance of poor
mixing.  If the acceptance rates are too low, then for subsequent analyses the user 
should <em>decrease</em> the scale of the tuning parameter (or "std," as in, e.g., 
"aD_std"), and if acceptance rates are too high, the user should <em>increase</em> the 
scale of the tuning parameter.  The scale of the tuning parameter is the standard 
deviation of the normal distribution from which the small random variable is drawn 
and added to the current parameter value to propose a move.  If the acceptance rate 
has not plateaued by the end of an analysis, it is an indication that the chain may 
still be "going somewhere" in parameter space, and subsequent analyses should be 
performed.
