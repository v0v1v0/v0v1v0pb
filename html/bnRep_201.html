<h2>suffocation Bayesian Network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Human-related hazardous events assessment for suffocation on ships by integrating Bayesian network and complex network.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A Gaussian Bayesian network to investigate the human-related factors associated with suffocation on ships during docking repair. The probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>N4</dt>
<dd>
<p>The safety supervisor on board the ship did not perceive the unsafe actions of the operators and failed to correct the inappropriate operations;</p>
</dd>
<dt>N5</dt>
<dd>
<p>The representative of the ship owner was absent during the operation;</p>
</dd>
<dt>N8</dt>
<dd>
<p>Nitrogen leakage</p>
</dd>

<p>The safety management department of the shipyard failed to strictly implement all safety measures during the holiday season;</p>
</dd>
