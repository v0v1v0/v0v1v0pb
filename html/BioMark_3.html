<h2>Set or return options for stability-based biomarker selection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function to set options for stability-based biomarker selection in
the <span class="pkg">BioMark</span> package, or to return the current options.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">biom.options(..., reset = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single list, a single character vector, or any number
of named arguments (<var>name = value</var>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reset</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: if TRUE all options are set to their factory
defaults.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If called with no arguments, or with an empty list as the single
argument, <code>biom.options</code> returns the current options.
</p>
<p>If called with a character vector as the single argument, a list with
the arguments named in the vector are returned.
</p>
<p>If called with a non-empty list as the single arguments, the list
elements should be named, and are treated as named arguments to the
function.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, <code>biom.options</code> should be called with one or more named
arguments <var>name = value</var>.  For each argument, the option named
<var>name</var> will be given the value <var>value</var>.
</p>
<p>The options are saved in an envirtonment variable
<code>.biom.Options</code>, and remain in effect until the end of the
session.  If the environment is saved upon exit, they will be
remembered in the next session.
</p>
<p>The recognised options are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>max.seg</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximal number of jackknife iterations. Default: 100.</p>
</dd>
<dt>oob.size, oob.fraction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Size of the out-of-bag fraction, either
given as an absolute number (oob.size) or as a fraction. Default is
to leave out ten percent. If oob.size is given explicitly, it takes
precedence over oob.fraction. Default: oob.fraction = .1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>variable.fraction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use 1 to always include all variables - use a
smaller fraction to have a different random subset of all variables
in each iteration (stability-based identification). Default: .7.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ntop</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of "top" coefficients taken into account in
stability-based biomarker identification. If a variable appears
consistently among the <code>ntop</code> biggest coefficients, it is said
to be stable. If ntop is a number between 0 and 1, it is taken to
indicate the fraction of variables to be included in the model.
Default: 10.</p>
</dd>
<dt>min.present</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimal fraction of times a variable should be in
the top list to be considered as a potential biomarker
(stability-based identification). Setting this
argument to 0 will lead to a list containing all coefficients that
were present in the top list at least once - a value of 1 only
returns those variables that are selected in every
iteration. Default: .1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>nset</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of permutations to establish null
distributions for PCR, PLS and VIP statistics in the
Higher-Criticism approach. Default: 10,000.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fmethods</dt>
<dd>
<p>All biomarker selection methods available within
BioMark. Currently equal to <code>c("studentt", "shrinkt", "pcr",
	"pls", "vip", "lasso"</code>. </p>
</dd> 
<dt>univ.methods</dt>
<dd>
<p>The names of the univariate biomarker selection
methods currently known to BioMark. Currently equal to
<code>c("studentt", "shrinkt")</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>HCalpha</dt>
<dd>
<p>The default of the alpha parameter in the HC
method. Value: 0.1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>lasso</dt>
<dd>
<p>a list of arguments passed to the underlying
<code>glmnet</code> function, such as <code>family</code>, <code>nlambda</code>,
<code>alpha</code>, <code>lambda</code>, or <code>lambda.min.ratio</code>. For
binary classification, the "binomial" family is the default, but
the most similar setting compared to the other methods in the package
is <code>family = "gaussian"</code>. For choices other than the default,
a warning is printed to the screen.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with the (possibly changed) options.  If any named argument (or
list element) was provided, the list is returned invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Side Effects</h3>

<p>If any named argument (or list element) was provided,
<code>biom.options</code> updates the elements of the option list
<code>.biom.Options$options</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function is based on the <code>pls.options</code>
function in package <span class="pkg">pls</span>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Return current options:
biom.options()
biom.options("max.seg")

## Set options:
biom.options(max.seg = 100, oob.fraction = .2)
biom.options(lasso = list(alpha = .75, nlambda = 50))
biom.options()
## the next line removes some options - for these, glmnet defaults will be used
biom.options(lasso = list(alpha = .9, family = "binomial"))

## Restore factory settings:
biom.options(reset = TRUE)
</code></pre>
