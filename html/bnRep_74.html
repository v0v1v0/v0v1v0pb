<h2>covidfear Bayesian Network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Learning and interpreting asymmetry-labeled DAGs: a case study on COVID-19 fear.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A discrete Bayesian network to understand the effect of demographic factors on the answers to the COVID-19 fear scale and the relationship between the scale items. The Bayesian network was learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Age</dt>
<dd>
<p>(Young, Adult);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gender</dt>
<dd>
<p>(Female, Male);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fear</dt>
<dd>
<p>I am most afraid of COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Think</dt>
<dd>
<p>It makes me uncomfortable to think about COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hands</dt>
<dd>
<p>My hands become clammy when I think about COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Life</dt>
<dd>
<p>I fear losing my life because of COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);</p>
</dd>
<dt>News</dt>
<dd>
<p>I become nervous or anxious when watching news and stories about COVID-19 on social media (Disagree, Neither, Agree);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sleep</dt>
<dd>
<p>I cannot sleep because I am worried about getting COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hearth</dt>
<dd>
<p>My heart races or palpitates when I think about getting COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);</p>
</dd>
</dl>
