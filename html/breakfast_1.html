<h2>Breakfast: Methods for Fast Multiple Change-point Detection and Estimation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A developing software suite for multiple change-point detection/estimation (data segmentation) in data sequences.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The current version implements methods for detecting changes in the data sequence modelled as (i) a piecewise-constant function plus i.i.d. Gaussian noise, 
(ii) a piecewise-constant function plus autoregressive time series,  
(iii) a piecewise-linear and continuous function plus i.i.d. Gaussian noise, and
(iv) a piecewise-linear and discontinuous function plus i.i.d. Gaussian noise.
This is carried out via a two-stage procedure combining solution path generation and model selection methodologies.
Change-point detection in breakfast is carried out in two stages, first the computation of a solution path, followed by a model selection step along the path. 
A variety of solution path and model selection methods are included, which can be accessed individually,
or through breakfast.
Currently supported solution path methods are: sol.idetect, sol.idetect_seq,
sol.wbs, sol.wbs2, sol.not, sol.tguh and sol.wcm.
</p>
<p>Currently supported model selection methods are: model.ic, model.lp,
model.sdll, model.thresh and model.gsa.
</p>
<p>Check back future versions for more change-point models and the corresponding methods.
