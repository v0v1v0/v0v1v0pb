<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Suppose <code class="reqn">X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots</code> are binary outcomes following Bernoulli
distribution <code class="reqn">b(1,p)</code>, in which 1 stands for the case that the subject
responds to the treatment and 0 otherwise. Consider a group sequential test
with <code class="reqn">K</code> planned analyses, where the null and alternative hypotheses are
<code class="reqn">H_0: p=p_0</code> and <code class="reqn">H_1: p=p_1</code> respectively. Note that generally
<code class="reqn">p_1</code> is greater than <code class="reqn">p_0</code>. For <code class="reqn">k&lt;K</code>, the trial stops if and
only if the test statistic <code class="reqn">Z_k</code> crosses the futility boundary, that is,
<code class="reqn">Z_k&lt;=l_k</code>. The lower bound for the last analysis <code class="reqn">l_K</code> is set to be
equal to the last and only upper bound <code class="reqn">u_K</code> to make a decision. At the
last analysis, the null hypothesis will be rejected if <code class="reqn">Z_K&gt;=u_K</code>.
</p>
<p>The computation of lower bounds except for the last one is implemented with
<code class="reqn">u_K</code> fixed, thus the derived lower bounds are non-binding. Furthermore,
the overall type I error will not be inflated if the trial continues after
crossing any of the interim lower bounds, which is convenient for the purpose
of monitoring. Let the sequence of sample sizes required at each analysis be
<code class="reqn">n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{K}</code>. For binomial endpoint, the Fisher
information equals <code class="reqn">n_k/p/(1-p)</code> which is proportional to <code class="reqn">n_k</code>.
Accordingly, the information fraction available at each analysis is equivalent
to <code class="reqn">n_k/n_K</code>.
</p>
<p>With exact test, the test statistic at analysis <code class="reqn">k</code> is <code class="reqn">Z_k=\sum_{s=1}^{n_k}X_s</code>
which follows binomial distribution <code class="reqn">b(n_k,p)</code>. Actually, <code class="reqn">Z_k</code> is the total
number of responses up to the kth analysis.
</p>
<p>Under the null hypothesis, <code class="reqn">Z_k</code> follows a binomial distribution <code class="reqn">b(n_k,p_0)</code>.
While under the alternative hypothesis, <code class="reqn">Z_k</code> follows <code class="reqn">b(n_k,p_1)</code>.
It may involve massive computation to simutaneously find proper <code class="reqn">n_K</code> and <code class="reqn">u_K</code>.
In fact, the sample sizes obtained from asymptotic test ought to be close to those from exact test.
Thus, we adopt <code class="reqn">n_K</code> from asymptotic test as the starting value. The starting value of <code class="reqn">u_K</code> is
computed given the <code class="reqn">n_K</code>. Iteratively update <code class="reqn">u_K</code> and <code class="reqn">n_K</code> until errors are limited to
certain amount.
</p>
<p>Like <code>asymdesign</code>, the lower boundaries for the first <code class="reqn">K-1</code> analyses are
sequentially determined by a search method. However, if the actual overall type II error exceeds the desired level,
not only sample sizes but also all the boundaries are updated, since the binomial distribution under <code class="reqn">H_0</code>
involves with sample size.
</p>
<p>Due to the discreteness of binomial distribution, in exact test, the type I and
type II error actually spent at each analysis may not approximate the designated
amount. With the only one upper bound, the whole type I error is spent at the final analysis.
From some simulation studies, though not presented here, we found that carrying over
unused type II error has minor influence on the resulting boundaries and sample sizes.
However, in an attempt to reduce the false positive rate, we decided to recycle the unspent
amount of desired type II error. Thus, the elements of betaspend in an exactdesign object may be greater than
the amount pre-specified by the user.
