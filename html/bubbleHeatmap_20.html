<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Nightingale Health is a Finnish company which has developed a fully
automated platform for deriving over 200 quantitative metabolomics measures
from a single blood serum sample using NMR technology, at a comparable cost
to standard lipid clinical chemistry. These measures include concentration
and composition of 14 lipoprotein subclasses, apolipoproteins, fatty acids,
amino acids and glycolysis related metabolites. Over 1M samples have already
been processed, including biobank participants, population cohorts and
clinical studies, with capacity to process an additional 250K samples per
year. Over 100K profiles of UK Biobank participants have recently been
released, with data on the remaining individuals to follow. The wide
availability of standardised Nightingale datasets in global cohorts
facilitates collaborative research and is contributing to the identification
of new biomarkers across a range of diseases.
