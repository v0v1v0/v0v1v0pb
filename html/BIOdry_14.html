<h2>Tree-ring width (TRW) chronology
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>TRW chronology for Pinus pinaster forests from two sample
plots in northern Spain (Soria) and east-central Spain (Cuenca). The
data set contains eight TRW series. To account for source variability,
two trees were selected per site, and two samples were extracted from
each tree.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Pchron)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

 <p><code>data.frame</code> object with eight columns.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Rows</dt>
<dd>
<p>Row names of the data set are time-units labels (years of formation).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Columns</dt>
<dd>
<p>Column names represent levels in three within-stand
ecological factors that are common to most TRW data and represent
variability in stand qualities (stand), tree-radial morphology
(sample), and tree genetics/phenotypes (tree).  The names are
dot-separated labels representing the hierarchy of the three
ecological factors, where higher ecological-factor levels are
defined first and lower levels after. For example, code
'P16106.17.a' is the column name of sample replicate 'a' in tree '17'
in plot 'P16106'.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p> This data set belongs to a more extensive tree-ring
chronology which was processed in previous studies (Bogino and Bravo,
2008) by measuring TRW in polished-core samples (5 mm diameter) using
the Windendro program and cross-dating the tree-ring chronologies using
COFECHA software. Time units for the TRWs are formation years spanning
from 1861 to 2005. The cross-dating records suggested that maritime pine
chronologies had high SNR: (23-28 in northern Spain, and 38-61 in
east-central Spain) and high EPS (0.96 in northern Spain, and 0.98 in
east-central Spain). </p>
