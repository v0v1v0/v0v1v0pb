<h2> Calculates the Unbiased Random Isonymy matrix </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>"uri" calculates the unbiased random isonymy coefficient starting from surname frequencies. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">uri(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p> is a surname frequency table where the N rows correspond to the surnames present in the whole population and the M columns are the (sub)populations </p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function implements Morton's isonymy method as outlined by Relethford. Unbiased estimations of intra-(sub)population isonymy were included.
Unbiased Random Isonymy is an argument needed to calculate 'a priori' and conditional kinship matrices using the "rel.phi" and "rel.cond" functions.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a square symmetric unbiased isonymy matrix. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The use of “uri” could be problematic, because different people are likely to arrange isonymy data in different ways on their computers. We decided for a matrix format for the isonymy data; the function would originally accept data in a different format and then convert it internally, but this would be a problem for people with data arranged in a different format. In the end we decided to write a specific function, "sur.freq", to generate surname frequency tables directly from raw marriage data or marriage-like data (the most commonly used sources in bio-demographic studies). For other types of surname data, see the verbose explanation in the info for the dataset "surnames" so it would be clear for the user how “uri” works.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># starting from a raw marriage records dataset:
data(valley)
tot &lt;- sur.freq(valley,valley$PAR,valley$SURM,valley$SURF)
tot # a frequency table calculated above all the surnames
iso.matrix &lt;- uri(tot)
iso.matrix # a unbiased random isonymy matrix

#starting from a generic surname frequency table
data(surnames)
surnames # a made-up dataset
# you can see that the surnames are arranged as the _rows_
# and the populations are the _columns_
# the function "uri" turns this data into a unbiased random isonymy matrix
