<h2>rainstorm Bayesian Network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Deduction of sudden rainstorm scenarios: integrating decision makers' emotions, dynamic Bayesian network and DS evidence theory.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A discrete Bayesian network to  simulate the dynamic change process of scenario deduction. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>EmAct1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Activate the flood prevention emergency plan; organize emergency rescue teams to garrison key safety points and increase the intensity of inspections; each site is equipped with sufficient special flood prevention materials and equipment (Effective, Void);</p>
</dd>
<dt>EmAct2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Improve the level of flood prevention emergency response; organize the maintenance of houses; restrict peopleâ€™s travel; clean up the water outlet in time; and do a good job in popularizing flood prevention emergency measures (Effective, Void);</p>
</dd>
<dt>EmAct3</dt>
<dd>
<p>Vigorous dredging of drainage channels, all personnel involved in flood control (Effective, Void);</p>
</dd>
<dt>EmAct4</dt>
<dd>
<p>Strengthen inspections and inspections of rivers, reservoirs, geological disasters, urban infrastructure, etc.; force all factories with hidden dangers (enterprises that may have water inlets and hot furnaces, etc.) to stop work and production (Effective, Void);</p>
</dd>
<dt>EmAct5</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enterprises continue to close down and add infrastructure (Effective, Void);</p>
</dd>
<dt>EmAct6</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange professional personnel to guide the dangerous situation of the reservoir on the spot; excavate the drainage trough as soon as possible to reduce the water level, add hydrological stations, and strengthen supervision and early warning (Effective, Void);</p>
</dd>
<dt>EmAct7</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extensive excavation of emergency drainage channels; transfer of personnel in hazardous areas; and increase of emergency equipment and medical teams (Effective, Void);</p>
</dd>
<dt>EmAct8</dt>
<dd>
<p>Accelerate the transfer of personnel from disaster areas, add high-tech rescue equipment (Effective,Void);</p>
