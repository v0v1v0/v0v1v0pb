(partly incomplete) observations. 
The list contains both information on the response (paired comparisons) and different covariates.

</li>
<li>
<p>first.object: Vector containing the first-named party per paired comparison
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>second.object: Vector containing the second-named party per paired comparison
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subject: Vector containing a person identifier per paired comparison
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with.order Automatically generated vector containing information on order effect. Irrelevant, because 
no order effect needs to be included in the analysis of GLES data. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
