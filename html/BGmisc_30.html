<h2>Infer Relatedness Coefficient</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function infers the relatedness coefficient between two groups based on
the observed correlation between their additive genetic variance and shared environmental variance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">inferRelatedness(obsR, aceA = 0.9, aceC = 0, sharedC = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obsR</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Observed correlation between the two groups. Must be between -1 and 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>aceA</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Proportion of variance attributable to additive genetic variance. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.9.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>aceC</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Proportion of variance attributable to shared environmental variance. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sharedC</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Proportion of shared environment shared between the two individuals. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function uses the ACE (Additive genetic, Common environmental, and Unique environmental) model to infer the relatedness between two individuals or groups.
By considering the observed correlation ('obsR'), the proportion of variance attributable to additive genetic variance ('aceA'), and the proportion of shared environmental variance ('aceC'), it calculates the relatedness coefficient.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Numeric. The calculated relatedness coefficient ('est_r').
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Infer the relatedness coefficient:
inferRelatedness(obsR = 0.5, aceA = 0.9, aceC = 0, sharedC = 0)

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
