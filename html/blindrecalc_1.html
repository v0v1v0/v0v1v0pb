<h2>Blinded Sample Size Recalculation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package <span class="pkg">blindrecalc</span> provides characteristics and plots
of trial designs with blinded sample size recalculation where
a nuisance parameter is estimated at an blinded interim analysis.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, for continuous outcomes, a t-test is implemented for superiority
and non-inferiority trials.
For superiority trials with binary endpoint, the chi^2-test is implemented.
The Farrington Manning test covers non-inferiority trials with binary endpoint.
