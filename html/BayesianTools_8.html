<h2>Checks if an object is of class 'BayesianSetup'</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function used to assure that an object is of class 'BayesianSetup'. If you pass a function, it is coverted to an object of class 'BayesianSetup' (using <code>createBayesianSetup</code>) before it is returned.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">checkBayesianSetup(bayesianSetup, parallel = F)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bayesianSetup</code></td>
<td>
<p>either object of class bayesianSetup or a log posterior function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>if bayesianSetup is a function, this will set the parallelization option for the class BayesianSetup that is created internally. If bayesianSetup is already a BayesianSetup, then this will check if parallel = T is requested but not supported by the BayesianSetup. This option is for internal use in the samplers</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The recommended option to use this function in the samplers is to have parallel with default NULL in the samplers, so that checkBayesianSetup with a function will create a bayesianSetup without parallelization, while it will do nothing with an existing BayesianSetup. If the user sets parallelization, it will set the approriate parallelization for a function, and check in case of an existing BayesianSetup. The checkBayesianSetup call in the samplers should then be followed by a check for parallel = NULL in sampler, in which case paralell can be set from the BayesianSetup
