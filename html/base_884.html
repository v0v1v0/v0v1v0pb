<h2>
LAPACK Library
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Report the name of the shared object file with <code>LAPACK</code> implementation
in use.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">La_library()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector of length one (<code>""</code> when the name is not known).
The value can be used as an indication of which <code>LAPACK</code>
implementation is in use.  Typically, the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> version of <code>LAPACK</code> will
appear as <code>libRlapack.so</code> (<code>libRlapack.dylib</code>), depending on how
R was built.  Note that <code>libRlapack.so</code> (<code>libRlapack.dylib</code>) may
also be shown for an external <code>LAPACK</code> implementation that had been
copied, hard-linked or renamed by the system administrator.  Otherwise,
the shared object file will be given and its path/name may indicate
the vendor/version.
</p>
<p>The detection does not work on Windows, nor for the Accelerate
framework on macOS, nor in the rare (and unsupported) case of a static
external library.
</p>
<p>It is possible to build <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> against an enhanced BLAS which contains
some but not all LAPACK routines, in which case this function reports
the library containing routine <code>ILAVER</code>.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>extSoftVersion</code> for versions of other third-party software
including <code>BLAS</code>.
</p>
<p><code>La_version</code> for the version of LAPACK in use.
