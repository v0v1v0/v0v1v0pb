names as years, and one numeric variable.</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>An numeric vector of event years for superposed epoch, such as
fire years, or an <code>fhx</code> object with a single series as produced by
<code>composite()</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) helps to evaluate fire-climate
relationships in studies of tree-ring fire history. It works by compositing
the values of an annual time series or climate reconstruction for the fire
years provided (<code>event</code>) and both positive and negative lag years.
Bootstrap resampling of the time series is performed to evaluate the
statistical significance of each year's mean value. Users interpret the
departure of the actual event year means from the simulated event year means.
Note that there is no rescaling of the climate time series <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>The significance of lag-year departures from the average climate condition
was first noted by Baisan and Swetnam (1990) and used in an organized SEA by
Swetnam (1993). Since then, the procedure has been commonly applied in fire
history studies. The FORTRAN program EVENT.exe was written by Richard Holmes
and Thomas Swetnam (Holmes and Swetnam 1994) to perform SEA for fire history
specifically. EVENT was incorporated in the FHX2 software by Henri
Grissino-Mayer. Further information about SEA can be found in the FHAES
user's manual, http://help.fhaes.org/.
</p>
<p><code>sea()</code> was originally designed to replicate EVENT as closely as possible. We
have tried to stay true to their implementation of SEA, although multiple
versions of the analysis exist in the climate literature and for fire
history. The outcome of EVENT and sea should only differ slightly in the
values of the simulated events and the departures, because random draws are
used. The event year and lag significance levels should match, at least in
the general pattern.
</p>
<p>Our SEA implementation borrowed from <code>dplR::sea()</code> function in how it
performs the bootstrap procedure, but differs in the kind of output provided
for the user.

</li>
<li>
<p> "random": a <code>data.frame</code> summary of the bootstrapped events.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "departure": a <code>data.frame</code> summary of the departures of actual from
bootstrapped events.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "simulated": a full 2D <code>matrix</code> of the bootstrapped-values across lags.
