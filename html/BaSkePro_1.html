<h2>
Bayesian Model to Archaeological Faunal Skeletal Profiles
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tool to perform Bayesian inference of carcass processing/transport strategy and bone attrition from archaeological faunal skeletal profiles characterized by percentages of MAU (Minimum Anatomical Units). The approach is based on a generative model for skeletal profiles that replicates the two phases of formation of any archaeofaunal assemblage: initial accumulation as a function of human transport strategies and subsequent attrition.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BaSkePro(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame object with the MAU (Minimum Anatomical Unit) percentage of one species in this specific order: Mandible, Atlas, Axis, Cervical vertebra, Thoracic vertebra, Lumbar vertebra, Rib, Sacrum, Scapula, Humerus, Radius (or radio-ulna), Metacarpal, Pelvis, Femur, Tibia, Metatarsal.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>    Two parameters define this model: 1) the transport preference (alpha), which can take any value between - 1 (mostly axial contribution) and 1 (mostly appendicular contribution) following strategies constructed as a function of butchering efficiency of different anatomical elements and the results of ethnographic studies, and 2) degree of attrition (beta), which can vary between 0 (no attrition) and 10 (maximum attrition) and relates the survivorship of bone elements to their maximum bone density.
Starting from uniform prior probability distribution functions of alpha and beta, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling based on a random walk Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is adopted to derive the posterior probability distribution functions, which are then available for interpretation. During this process, the likelihood of obtaining the observed percentages of MAU given a pair of parameter values is estimated by the inverse of the Chi2 statistic, multiplied by the proportion of elements within a 1 percent of the observed value.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p> A table and histograms with  posterior probability distribution functions of alpha and beta parameters (the first and fourth quartiles).
