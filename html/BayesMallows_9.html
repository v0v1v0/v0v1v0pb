<h2>Simulated intransitive pairwise preferences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated dataset based on the potato_visual data. Based on
the rankings in potato_visual, all n-choose-2 = 190 pairs of items were
sampled from each assessor. With probability .9, the pairwise
preference was in agreement with potato_visual, and with probability .1,
they were in disagreement. Hence, the data generating mechanism was a
Bernoulli error model (Crispino et al. 2019) with
<code class="reqn">\theta=0.1</code>.
