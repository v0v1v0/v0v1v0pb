<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes the operating characteristics for standard
group testing algorithms with a multiplex assay that tests for two diseases.
Calculations for hierarchical group testing algorithms are performed as
described in Bilder et al. (2019) and calculations for array-based group
testing algorithms are performed as described in Hou et al. (2019).
</p>
<p>Available algorithms include two-, three-, four-, and five-stage
hierarchical testing and array testing with and without master pooling. Both
non-informative and informative group testing settings are allowed for
hierarchical algorithms. Only non-informative group testing settings are
allowed for array testing algorithms. Operating characteristics calculated
are expected number of tests, pooling sensitivity, pooling specificity,
pooling positive predictive value, and pooling negative predictive value for
each individual.
</p>
<p>For informative algorithms where the <kbd>alpha</kbd> argument is specified, a
heterogeneous matrix of joint probabilities for each individual is generated
using the Dirichlet distribution. This is done using
<code>rBeta2009::rdirichlet</code> and requires the user to set a seed to
reproduce results. See Bilder et al. (2019) for additional details on the
use of the Dirichlet distribution for this purpose.
</p>
<p>The sensitivity/specificity values are allowed to vary across stages of
testing. For hierarchical testing, a different sensitivity/specificity value
may be used for each stage of testing. For array testing, a different
sensitivity/specificity value may be used for master pool testing (if
included), row/column testing, and individual testing. The values must be
specified in the order of the testing performed. For example, values are
specified as (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3) for three-stage hierarchical
testing or (master pool testing, row/column testing, individual testing) for
array testing with master pooling. A vector of 2
sensitivity/specificity values may be specified, and sensitivity/specificity
values for all stages of testing are assumed to be equal. The first value in
the vector will be used at each stage of testing for the first disease, and
the second value in the vector will be used at each stage of testing for the
second disease.
</p>
<p>The matrix specified  by <kbd>hier.config</kbd> defines the hierarchical group
testing algorithm for <code class="reqn">I</code> individuals. The rows of the matrix correspond
to the stages <code class="reqn">s=1,...,S</code> in the testing algorithm, and the columns
correspond to individuals <code class="reqn">i=1,...I</code>. The cell values within the matrix
represent the group number of individual <code class="reqn">i</code> at stage <code class="reqn">s</code>. For
three-stage, four-stage, five-stage, and non-informative two-stage
hierarchical testing, the first row of the matrix consists of all ones. This
indicates that all individuals in the algorithm are tested together in a
single group in the first stage of testing. For informative two-stage
hierarchical testing, the initial group (block) is not tested. Thus, the
first row of the matrix consists of the group numbers for each individual
in the first stage of testing. For all hierarchical algorithms, the final
row of the matrix denotes individual testing. Individuals who are not tested
in a particular stage are represented by "NA" (e.g., an individual tested in
a group of size 1 in the second stage of testing would not be tested again
in a third stage of testing). It is important to note that this matrix
represents the testing that could be performed if each group tests
positively at each stage prior to the last. For more details on this matrix
(called a group membership matrix), see Bilder et al. (2019).
</p>
<p>For array testing without master pooling, the <kbd>rowcol.sz</kbd> specified
represents the row/column size for initial (stage 1) testing. For array
testing with master pooling, the <kbd>rowcol.sz</kbd> specified represents the
row/column size for stage 2 testing. This is because the master pool size is
the overall array size, given by the square of the row/column size.
</p>
<p>The displayed overall pooling sensitivity, pooling specificity, pooling
positive predictive value, and pooling negative predictive value are
weighted averages of the corresponding individual accuracy measures for all
individuals within the initial group (or block) for a hierarchical
algorithm, or within the entire array for an array-based algorithm.
Expressions for these averages are provided in the Supplementary Material
for Hitt et al. (2019). These expressions are based on accuracy definitions
given by Altman and Bland (1994a, 1994b).

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function returns the pooling positive and negative
predictive values for all individuals even though these measures are
diagnostic specific; e.g., the pooling positive predictive value should
only be considered for those individuals who have tested positive.
</p>
<p>Additionally, only stage dependent sensitivity and specificity values are
allowed within the program (no group within stage dependent values are
allowed). See Bilder et al. (2019) for additional information.
