"range map" or "checklist" is chosen, the user must provide a shapefile with 
either the species range map, or the features representing regions where it 
has been listed as native. Default is "gift".</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nat_ref_reg</code></td>
<td>
<p>shapefile containing either the species native range map

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a list containing three shapefiles derived by 
information supplied by GloNAF for the alien reference regions, and the
chosen source for the native reference regions. "regs" includes all the 
features corresponding to regions where the species has been listed as 
present. "regs_native" includes all the features corresponding to regions 
where the species has been listed as native. And "regs_alien" includes all 
the features corresponding to regions where the species has been listed as 
alien.
