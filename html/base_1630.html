<h2>Check if a Character Vector is Validly Encoded</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check if each element of a character vector is valid in its implied
encoding.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">validUTF8(x)
validEnc(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These use similar checks to those used by functions such as
<code>grep</code>.
</p>
<p><code>validUTF8</code> ignores any marked encoding (see
<code>Encoding</code>) and so looks directly if the bytes in each
string are valid UTF-8.  (For the validity of ‘noncharacters’
see the help for <code>intToUtf8</code>.)
</p>
<p><code>validEnc</code> regards character strings as validly encoded unless
their encodings are marked as UTF-8 or they are unmarked and the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
session is in a UTF-8 or other multi-byte locale.  (The checks in
other multi-byte locales depend on the OS and as with
<code>iconv</code> not all invalid inputs may be detected.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A logical vector of the same length as <code>x</code>.   <code>NA</code> elements
are regarded as validly encoded.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It would be possible to check for the validity of character strings in
a Latin-1 encoding, but extensions such as CP1252 are widely accepted
as ‘Latin-1’ and 8-bit encodings rarely need to be checked for
validity.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x &lt;-
  ## from example(text)
c("Jetz", "no", "chli", "z\xc3\xbcrit\xc3\xbc\xc3\xbctsch:",
  "(noch", "ein", "bi\xc3\x9fchen", "Z\xc3\xbc", "deutsch)",
   ## from a CRAN check log
   "\xfa\xb4\xbf\xbf\x9f")
validUTF8(x)
validEnc(x) # depends on the locale
Encoding(x) &lt;-"UTF-8"
validEnc(x) # typically the last, x[10], is invalid

## Maybe advantageous to declare it "unknown":
G &lt;- x ; Encoding(G[!validEnc(G)]) &lt;- "unknown"
try( substr(x, 1,1) ) # gives 'invalid multibyte string' error in a UTF-8 locale
try( substr(G, 1,1) ) # works in a UTF-8 locale
nchar(G) # fine, too
## but it is not "more valid" typically:
all.equal(validEnc(x),
          validEnc(G)) # typically TRUE
</code></pre>
