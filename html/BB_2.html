<p>A tutorial style introduction to this package is available in a vignette, which
can be viewed with vignette("BB").
</p>
<p>The main functions in this package are:
</p>
<pre>

BBsolve A wrapper function to provide a robust stategy for solving large 
        systems of nonlinear equations. It calls dfsane with different 
	algorithm control settings, until a successfully converged solution
	is obtained.

BBoptim A wrapper function to provide a robust stategy for real valued function 
        optimization. It calls spg with different algorithm control settings, 
	until a successfully converged solution is obtained.

dfsane  function for solving large systems of nonlinear equations using a 
        derivative-free spectral approach 

sane	function for solving large systems of nonlinear equations using 
        spectral approach

spg	function for spectral projected gradient method for large-scale 
        optimization with simple constraints
