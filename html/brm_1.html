<h2>Fitting Binary Regression Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>brm</code> in this package provides an alternative to generalized linear models for fitting binary regression models, in which both the response <code class="reqn">y</code> and the primary exposure of interest <code class="reqn">x</code> are binary. This is  especially useful if the interest lies in estimating the association between <code class="reqn">x</code> and <code class="reqn">y</code>, and how that association varies as a function of (other) covariates <code class="reqn">v</code>.
</p>
<p>Unlike <code>glm</code>, which uses a single link function for the outcome, <code>brm</code> separates the nuisance model from the target model. This separation provides opportunities to choose nuisance models independently of the target model. To see why this is important, we may contrast it with the use of a GLM to model the log relative risk. In this setting one might use a Poisson regression (with interaction term) <code class="reqn">log P(y = 1|x, va, vb) = \alpha * x * va + \beta * vb</code> (though such a model ignores the fact that <code class="reqn">y</code> is binary); here <code class="reqn">va</code> and <code class="reqn">vb</code> are subsets of <code class="reqn">v</code>. Such a Poisson model can be seen as a combination of two parts: a target model <code class="reqn">log RR(va) = \alpha * va</code> and a nuisance model <code class="reqn">log P(y = 1|x = 0, vb) = \beta *  vb</code>. However, this nuisance model is variation dependent of the target model so that predicted probabilities may go outside of <code class="reqn">[0,1]</code>. Furthermore, one cannot solve this problem under a GLM framework as with a GLM, the target model and nuisance model are determined  <em>simultaneously</em> through a link function.
</p>
<p>More specifically, if the target model is a linear model on the conditional log Relative Risk (log RR) or ('logistically' transformed) conditional Risk Difference (atanh RD), <code>brm</code> fits a linear nuisance model for the conditional log Odds Product (log OP).  If the target model is a linear model on the conditional log Odds Ratio (log OR), <code>brm</code> fits a linear nuisance model on the conditional logit baseline risk, logit P(y = 1|x = 0, vb). Note in this case the target and nuisance models combine to form a simple logistic regression model (which is fitted using <code>glm</code>). 
</p>
<p><code>brm</code> fits the three target models described above as they are simple and the parameter space is unconstrained. <code>brm</code> fits the nuisance models above as they are variation independent of the corresponding target model. This variation independence greatly facilitates parameter estimation and interpretation. 
</p>
<p><code>brm</code> also provides doubly robust fitting as an option such that the estimates for <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> are still consistent and asymptotically normal even when the nuisance model is misspecified, provided that we have a correctly specified logistic model for the exposure probability <code class="reqn">P(x=1|v)</code>. Such doubly robust estimation is only possible for the Relative Risk and Risk Difference, but not the Odds Ratio.
