<h2>Compare Nested Bradley Terry Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compare nested models inheriting from class <code>"BTm"</code>. For models with no
random effects, compute analysis of deviance table, otherwise compute Wald
tests of additional terms.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'BTm'
anova(object, ..., dispersion = NULL, test = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>a fitted object of class inheriting from <code>"BTm"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional <code>"BTm"</code> objects.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dispersion</code></td>
<td>
<p>a value for the dispersion. Not implemented for models
with random effects.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional character string (partially) matching one of
<code>"Chisq"</code>, <code>"F"</code> or <code>"Cp"</code> to specify that p-values should be
returned.  The Chisq test is a likelihood ratio test for models with no
random effects, otherwise a Wald test. Options <code>"F"</code> and <code>"Cp"</code>
are only applicable to models with no random effects, see
<code>stat.anova()</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For models with no random effects, an analysis of deviance table is computed
using <code>anova.glm()</code>. Otherwise, Wald tests are computed as
detailed here.
</p>
<p>If a single object is specified, terms are added sequentially and a Wald
statistic is computed for the extra parameters. If the full model includes
player covariates and there are players with missing values over these
covariates, then the <code>NULL</code> model will include a separate ability for
these players. If there are missing values in any contest-level variables in
the full model, the corresponding contests will be omitted throughout. The
random effects structure of the full model is assumed for all sub-models.
</p>
<p>For a list of objects, consecutive pairs of models are compared by computing
a Wald statistic for the extra parameters in the larger of the two models.
</p>
<p>The Wald statistic is always based on the variance-covariance matrix of the
larger of the two models being compared.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"anova"</code> inheriting from class
<code>"data.frame"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>The comparison between two or more models will only be
valid if they are fitted to the same dataset. This may be a problem if there
are missing values and 's default of <code>na.action = na.omit</code> is used. An
error will be returned in this case.
</p>
<p>The same problem will occur when separate abilities have been estimated for
different subsets of players in the models being compared. However no
warning is given in this case.
