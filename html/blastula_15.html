<h2>A spacer block</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>With <code>block_spacer()</code> we can more easily define an area of whitespace in a
block-based layout. This function is meant to be easily combined with other
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠block_*()⁠</code> functions. Like all <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠block_*()⁠</code> functions, <code>block_spacer()</code> must
be placed inside of <code>blocks()</code> and the resultant <code>blocks</code> object can be
provided to the <code>body</code>, <code>header</code>, or <code>footer</code> arguments of <code>compose_email()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">block_spacer()
</code></pre>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Create a block of two, side-by-side
# articles with two `article()` calls
# inside of `block_articles()`, itself
# placed in `blocks()`; include some
# introductory text and place extra
# space around that text (with
# `block_spacer()`)

        block_text(
          "These are two of the cities I visited this year.
          I liked them a lot, so, I'll visit them again!"),

              Not the one in Los Angeles.
