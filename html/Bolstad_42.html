<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simulated population made up of 100 individuals. The individuals come from
three ethnic groups with population proportions of 40%, 40%, and 20%,
respectively. There are twenty neighborhoods, and five individuals live in

ethnic groups.  Also, individuals in the same neighborhood tend to be more
similar than individuals in different neighborhoods.
