<h2>Return the current high-resolution real time.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Time is expressed as seconds since some arbitrary time in the past; it
is not correlated in any way to the time of day, and thus is not subject to
resetting or drifting. The hi-res
timer is ideally suited to performance measurement tasks, where cheap,
accurate interval timing is required.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hires_time()
</code></pre>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hires_time()

# R rounds doubles to 7 digits by default, see greater precision by setting
# the digits argument when printing
print(hires_time(), digits = 20)

# Generally used by recording two times and then subtracting them
start &lt;- hires_time()
end &lt;- hires_time()
elapsed &lt;- end - start
elapsed
</code></pre>
