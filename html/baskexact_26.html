<h2>Class OneStageBasket</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>OneStageBasket is an S4 class. An object of this class contains the most
important design features of a single-stage basket trial.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This class implements a single-stage basket trial based on the power prior
design or the design proposed by Fujikawa et al. In these designs,
information is borrowed between baskets by calculating weights that
reflect the similarity between the baskets (and optionally the overall
heterogeneity). Posterior distributions for each basket are beta
distributions where the parameters are found by adding weighted sums
of the observed responses and non-responses in each basket to the
prior parameters (or in case of Fujikawa's design by calculating
weighted sums of the individual posterior distributions).
</p>
<p>Currently only common prior distributions and a common null
hypothesis are supported.
