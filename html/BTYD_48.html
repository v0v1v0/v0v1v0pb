<h2>Build Customer-by-Time Matrix from Event Log</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a customer-by-time matrix from an event log.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dc.BuildCBTFromElog(elog, statistic = "freq")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>elog</code></td>
<td>
<p>event log, which is a data frame with columns for customer ID
("cust"), date ("date"), and optionally other columns such as "sales". Each
row represents an event, such as a transaction.. For the total spend and
average spend matrices, the event log must have a "sales" column. If the
dates are not formatted to be in the order year-month-day, the columns of
the customer-by-time matrix may not be ordered chronologically if the
"date" column does not consist of date objects (R will order them
alphabetically). This will cause problems with other functions, so it is
better to convert the date column to date objects before running this
function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statistic</code></td>
<td>
<p>either "freq", "reach", "total.spend", or
"average.spend". This determines what type of customer-by-time matrix is
returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Customer-by-time matrix.
