<h2>
Yeast cell cycle time series data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Preprocessed time series measurements of four genes from the yeast cell cycle data by Spellman et al.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(yeastTimeSeries)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A matrix with 14 measurements for the genes Fhk2, Swi5, Sic1, and Clb1. Each gene is a row of the matrix, and each column is a measurement.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data were obtained from the web site of the yeast cell cycle analysis project. The time series synchronized with the elutriation method were extracted for the genes Fhk2, Swi5, SIC1, and Clb1. In a preprocessing step, missing values were imputed by taking the means of the measurements of the same genes at neighbouring time points.
