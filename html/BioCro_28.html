<h2>Miscanthus assimilation field data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Assimilation in Miscanthus as measured in Beale, Bint, and Long 1996.  The
first column is the observed net assimilation rate (micromoles m^-2 s^-1).
The second column is the observed quantum flux (micromoles m^-2 s^-1).
The third column is the temperature (degrees Celsius). Relative humidity
was not reported and thus was assumed to be 0.7.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame of dimensions 27 by 4.</p>
