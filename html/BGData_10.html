<h2>File-Backed Matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions with the <code>chunkSize</code> parameter work best with file-backed
matrices such as <code>BEDMatrix</code> objects. To avoid loading the whole,
potentially very large matrix into memory, these functions will load chunks
of the file-backed matrix into memory and perform the operations on one
chunk at a time. The size of the chunks is determined by the
<code>chunkSize</code> parameter. Care must be taken to not set <code>chunkSize</code>
too high to avoid memory shortage, particularly when combined with parallel
computing.
