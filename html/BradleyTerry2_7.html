<h2>Male Cape Dwarf Chameleons: Measured Traits and Contest Outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data as used in the study by Stuart-Fox et al. (2006).  Physical
measurements made on 35 male Cape dwarf chameleons, and the results of 106
inter-male contests.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">chameleons
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing three data frames: <code>chameleons$winner</code>,
<code>chameleons$loser</code> and <code>chameleons$predictors</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>chameleons$winner</code> and <code>chameleons$loser</code> data frames each
have 106 observations (one per contest) on the following 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with 35 levels <code>C01</code>, <code>C02</code>,
... , <code>C43</code>, the identity of the winning (or losing) male in each
contest</p>
</dd>
<dt>prev.wins.1</dt>
<dd>
<p>integer (values 0 or 1), did the
winner/loser of this contest win in an immediately previous contest?</p>
</dd>
<dt>prev.wins.2</dt>
<dd>
<p>integer (values 0, 1 or 2), how many of his
(maximum) previous 2 contests did each male win?</p>
</dd>
<dt>prev.wins.all</dt>
<dd>
<p>integer, how many previous contests has each
male won?</p>
</dd> </dl>
<p>The <code>chameleons$predictors</code> data frame has 35 observations, one for
each male involved in the contests, on the following 7 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ch.res</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, residuals of casque height regression on
<code>SVL</code>, i.e. relative height of the bony part on the top of the
chameleons' heads</p>
</dd>
<dt>jl.res</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, residuals of jaw length
regression on <code>SVL</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>tl.res</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, residuals of tail
length regression on <code>SVL</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>mass.res</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, residuals
of body mass regression on <code>SVL</code> (body condition)</p>
</dd>
<dt>SVL</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, snout-vent length (body size)</p>
</dd>
<dt>prop.main</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, proportion (arcsin transformed) of area of
the flank occupied by the main pink patch on the flank</p>
</dd>
<dt>prop.patch</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, proportion (arcsin transformed) of area
of the flank occupied by the entire flank patch</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The published paper mentions 107 contests, but only 106 contests are
included here.  Contest number 16 was deleted from the data used to fit the
models, because it involved a male whose predictor-variables were incomplete
(and it was the only contest involving that lizard, so it is uninformative).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
##
## Reproduce Table 3 from page 1268 of the above paper:
##
summary(chameleon.model &lt;- BTm(player1 = winner, player2 = loser,
  formula = ~ prev.wins.2 + ch.res[ID] + prop.main[ID] + (1|ID), id = "ID",
  data = chameleons))
head(BTabilities(chameleon.model))
##
## Note that, although a per-chameleon random effect is specified as in the
## above [the term "+ (1|ID)"], the estimated variance for that random
## effect turns out to be zero in this case.  The "prior experience"
## effect ["+ prev.wins.2"] in this analysis has explained most of the
## variation, leaving little for the ID-specific predictors to do.
## Despite that, two of the ID-specific predictors do emerge as
## significant.
##
## Test whether any of the other ID-specific predictors has an effect:
##
add1(chameleon.model, ~ . + jl.res[ID] + tl.res[ID] + mass.res[ID] +
  SVL[ID] + prop.patch[ID])
