<h2>The Regression Game</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>regression</code> function is used for solving problems in the data-based
game ,,The regression Game”.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">regression(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>regression</code> function is called with different arguments, which
vary depending on a problem that Beta and Bit are trying to solve. See
<code>Details</code> in order to learn more about the list of possible arguments.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Every time when some additional hints are needed one should add
<code>hint = TRUE</code> or <code>techHint = TRUE</code> argument to the <code>regression</code> function.
Technical hints will point out R packages and/or functions which might help
you to solve the task while "normal" hints provide you with methodological
advices.
</p>
<p>In this game you are helping Professor Pearson.
You can communicate with him through the <code>regression</code> function.
</p>
<p>In each call include the <code>subject</code> parameter (indicating which task
you are trying to answer) and the <code>content</code> parameter (providing
information Professor Pearson is asking you for in a given task).
</p>
<p>Data used in the game comes from the study of Polish upper-secondary
schools first grade students. It was conducted together with the
PISA 2009 study using the same cognitive tests and questionnaires as
in PISA 2009 but on a different group of students (in Poland most of the
students in a PISA sample attends lower-secondary schools). The students who
participated in the first wave of the study were followed in the 2nd grade of
upper-secondary school within the research program <em>Our further study
and work</em> (<em>Nasza Dalsza Nauka i Praca</em>). Both studies were conducted by
the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology Polish Academy of Sciences.
<strong>The original data was changed a little, to better fit the purpose of
the game.</strong>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function returns one of three possible values:
</p>

<ul>
<li>

<li>
<p><code>FALSE</code> if you provided wrong answer to a task,
</p>
</li>
<li>
