<h2>Detecting OpenMP</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> This package was designed for OpenMP.  For example, the
<code>pwbart</code> function can use OpenMP or the parallel R package for
multi-threading.  On UNIX/Unix-like systems, OpenMP, if available, is
discovered at install time; for the details, see the
<code>configure.ac</code> file which can be found in the source version of
this package.  However, we know of no GPL licensed code available to
detect OpenMP on Windows (for Artistic licensed OpenMP detection code
on Windows, see the Bioconductor R package rGADEM).  To determine
whether OpenMP is available at run time, we provide the function
documented here.  </p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mc.cores.openmp()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a zero when OpenMP is not available, otherwise, an integer
greater than zero when OpenMP is available (returns one unless
you are running in a multi-threaded process).
