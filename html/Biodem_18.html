<h2> Calculates surnames frequency tables </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>“sur.freq”calculates surnames frequency tables starting from raw marriage data or equivalent sources (i.e. birth registrations)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sur.freq(x,pop,mal.sur,fem.sur,freq.table="total")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p> is a data frame in which every row corresponds to a different marriage record. The data frame must contain: <b>a</b> a column reporting the population in which the marriage was recorded; <b>b</b> a column containing male surnames; <b>c</b> a column containing female surnames </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop</code></td>
<td>
<p> is the name of the column in the data frame that reports the population in which the marriage was recorded </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mal.sur</code></td>
<td>
<p> is the name of the column in the data frame that contains male surnames </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fem.sur</code></td>
<td>
<p> is the name of the column in the data frame that comtains female surnames </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>freq.table</code></td>
<td>
<p> character string specifying the type of surname frequency table to be calculated. The available options are: "males" (table calculated using only male surnames); "females" (table calculated using only female surnames); "total" (table calculated using all the surnames); "marriages" (tables calculated using observed pairs of surnames in each population). The default option is "total". </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>“sur.freq” is specifically written to derive surname frequency tables from marriage data, or, more generally, data in which appear couples of related surnames, as birth records etc. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A single table of surname frequencies ("male", "female", "total" options) or tables of observed pairs of surnames frequencies for each population ("marriages" option)
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Surname frequency tables produced with “sur.freq” are intended to be used as an argument for other functions to investigate the bio-demographic structure of populations. In particular, the "male", "female" and "total" options produce tables to be used in inter-population analyses (maesures of kinship/distance between populations, etc.); the "marriage" option produces tables to be used in intra-population analyses (inbreeding levels etc.). 
Tables of surname frequencies can also be obtained from simple lists of surnames (i.e. telephone directories, etc.) using the function “table”; for further explanations see the info for the "surnames" data set.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(valley)
valley #a subset of a real marriage data base

# you can see that marriages correspond to rows in the data frame.
# Note that the data frame contains other columns 

tot &lt;- sur.freq(valley,valley$PAR,valley$SURM,valley$SURF)
tot # a frequency table calculated above all the surnames
mal &lt;- sur.freq(valley,valley$PAR,valley$SURM,valley$SURF,freq.table="males")
mal # a frequency table calculated above the male surnames
fem &lt;- sur.freq(valley,valley$PAR,valley$SURM,valley$SURF,freq.table="females")
fem # a frequency table calculated above the female surnames
mar &lt;- sur.freq(valley,valley$PAR,valley$SURM,valley$SURF,freq.table="marriages")
mar # frequency tables for the observed pairs of surnames in each population
