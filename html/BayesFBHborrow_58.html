<h2>Example data, simulated from a Weibull distribution</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data is simulated for a historical trial with two columns named "tte" 
(time-to-event) and "event" (event indicator).
It was simulated using the following parameters:
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(weibull_hist)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 100 rows and 2 columns.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(weibull_cc)
data(weibull_hist)
weibull_hist$X_trt &lt;- 0
survival_model &lt;- survival::survfit(survival::Surv(tte, event) ~ X_trt, 
                                    data = rbind(weibull_cc, 
                                    weibull_hist))
line_colors &lt;- c("blue", "red", "green")  # Adjust colors as needed
