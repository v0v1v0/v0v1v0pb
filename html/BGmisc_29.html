<h2>Artificial pedigree data on eight families with inbreeding</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset created purely from imagination that includes several types of inbreeding.
Different kinds of inbreeding occur in each extended family.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(inbreeding)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame (and ped object) with 134 rows and 7 variables
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The types of inbreeding are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Extended Family 1: Sister wives - Children with the same father and different mothers who are sisters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Extended Family 2: Full siblings have children.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Extended Family 3: Half siblings have children.
</p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Extended Family 7: Uncle-niece and Aunt-nephew have children.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Extended Family 8: A father-son pairs has children with a corresponding mother-daughter pair.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not all of the above structures are technically inbreeding, they aim to test pedigree diagramming and path tracing algorithms.
</p>
<p>The variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ID</code>:  Person identification variable
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sex</code>:  Sex of the ID: 1 is female; 0 is male
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>dadID</code>:  ID of the father
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>momID</code>:  ID of the mother
