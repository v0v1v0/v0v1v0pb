<h2>Exploring Relationships in Body Dimensions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains 21 body dimension measurements as well as age, 
weight, height, and gender on 507 individuals. The 247 men and 260 
women were primarily individuals in their twenties and thirties, with a 
scattering of older men and women, all exercising several hours a week.

<p>Measurements were initially taken by Grete 
Heinz and Louis J. Peterson - at San Jose State University and at the 
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Later, 
measurements were taken at dozens of California health and fitness 
clubs by technicians under the supervision of one of these authors.
