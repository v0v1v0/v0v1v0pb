<h2>Molecular markers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Is a matrix (599 x 1279) with DArT genotypes; data are
from pure lines and genotypes were coded as 0/1 denoting
the absence/presence of the DArT. Markers with a
minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 were removed, and
missing genotypes were imputed with samples from the
marginal distribution of marker genotypes, that is, <code class="reqn">x_{ij}=Bernoulli(\hat p_j)</code>, where  <code class="reqn">\hat p_j</code>  
is the estimated allele frequency computed from the non-missing genotypes. The number of DArT 
MMs after edition was 1279.
