<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Short-term instead of long-term rainfall time series in rainwater harvesting simulation in houses: An assessment using Bayesian Network.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A discrete Bayesian network to predict if a given short-term time series leads to results similar to those obtained using a long-term time series. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:

<dl>
<dt>Representativeness</dt>
<dd>
<p>(Yes, No);</p>
</dd>
<dt>SeriesLength</dt>
<dd>
<p>(One Year, Two Year, Three Year, Four Year, Five Year, Six Year, Seven Year, Eigth Year, Nine Year, Ten Year, Fifteen Year, Twenty Year);</p>
</dd>
<dt>SeasonalityIndex</dt>
<dd>
<p>(High, Medium, Low);</p>
</dd>
<dt>RainwaterDemand</dt>
<dd>
<p>(Demand 20, Demand 30, Demand 40, Demand 50);</p>
</dd>
<dt>AverageAnnualRainfall</dt>
<dd>
<p>(High, Medium, Low);</p>
</dd>
<dt>AverageNumberOfDryDaysPerYear</dt>
<dd>
<p>(High, Medium, Low);</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>bn.fit</code>. Refer to the documentation of <code>bnlearn</code> for details.
