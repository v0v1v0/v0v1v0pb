<h2>Bayesian Latent Space Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>R package allowing the computation of a Bayesian Latent Space Model for complex networks. 
</p>
<p>Latent Space Models are characterized by the presence of unobservable variables (latent coordinates) that are used to 
compute the likelihood of the observed networks. Their goal is to map the observed network in the latent
space by meeting specific probabilistic requirements, so that the estimated latent coordinates can then be used to 
describe and characterize the original graph.
</p>
<p>In the BSLM package framework, given a network characterized by its adjacency <code class="reqn">Y</code> matrix, the model assigns a binary random 
variable to each tie: <code class="reqn">Y_ij</code> is related to the tie between nodes <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> and its value is 1
if the tie exists, 0 otherwise. 
</p>
<p>The model assumes the independence of <code class="reqn">Y_ij | x_i,x_j, \alpha</code>, where <code class="reqn">x_i</code> and <code class="reqn">x_j</code> are the coordinates
of the nodes in the multidimensional latent space and <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> is an additional parameter such that 
<code class="reqn">logit(P(Y_ij = 1)) = \alpha - ||x_i -x_j||</code>.
</p>
<p>The latent space coordinates are estimated by following a MCMC procedure that is based on the overall likelihood induced by the above equation. 
</p>
<p>Due to the symmetry of the distance, the model leads to more intuitive outputs for undirected networks, 
but the functions can also deal with directed graphs.
</p>
<p>If the network is weighted, i.e. to each tie is associated a positive coefficient, the model's probability equation
becomes <code class="reqn">logit(P(Y_ij = 1)) = \alpha - W_ij||x_i -x_j||</code>, where <code class="reqn">W_ij</code> denotes the weight related to link existing between <code class="reqn">x_i</code> and <code class="reqn">x_j</code>. 
This means that even non existing links should have a weight, therefore the matrix used in the computation isn't the original weights matrix but
actually a specific "BLSM weights" matrix that contains positive coefficients for all the possible pairs of nodes. 
When dealing with weighted networks, please be careful to pass a "BLSM weights" matrix as input 
#' (please refer to example_weights_matrix for more detailed information and a valid example).
</p>
<p>The output of the model allows the user to inspect the MCMC simulation, create insightful graphical representations or 
apply clustering techniques to better describe the latent space. 
See estimate_latent_positions or plot_latent_positions for further information.
