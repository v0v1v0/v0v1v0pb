<h2>Covariate balance checking through the nearest neighbor graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function tests whether covariates in a treatment group and a matched control group are balanced in observational studies through the nearest neighbor graph constructed on the subjects.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CrossNN(distM,treated.index,perm=0,k=1,discrete.correction=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distM</code></td>
<td>
<p>The distance matrix for the pooled observations (pooled over the treated subjects and the matched controls). If there are n treated subjects and n matched controls, then this distance matrix is a 2n by 2n matrix with the [i,j] element the distance between observation i and observation j.  What distance to use is decided by users. Some simple choices are the Euclidean distance, L1 distance, and mahalanobis distance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treated.index</code></td>
<td>
<p>The subject indices of the treated subjects.  The subjects are ordered in the same way as for calculating the distance matrix, distM.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of permutations performed to calculate the p-value of the test. The default value is 0, which means the permutation is not performed and only approximate p-value based on asymptotic theory is provided.  Doing permutation could be time consuming, so be cautious if you want to set this value to be larger than 10,000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>Set as positive integer values, indicates k-NN is used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>discrete.correction</code></td>
<td>
<p>When this is set as TRUE (recommended), a continuation correction is done for computing the asymptotic p-value to account for the discrete nature of the statistic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test.stat.Z</code></td>
<td>
<p>The standardized test statistic (ZD in the reference paper.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pval.appr</code></td>
<td>
<p>The approximated p-value based on asymptotic theory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pval.perm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The permutation p-value when argument 'perm' is positive.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## A snippet of the smoking example in the reference paper.
## smoking.rda contains a 300 by 300 distance matrix, smokingDist.
## The indices of the treated subjects are 1:150. 
data(smoking)
CrossNN(smokingDist, 1:150)

## Uncomment the following line to get permutation p-value with 1,000 permutations.
# CrossNN(smokingDist, 1:150, perm=1000)
