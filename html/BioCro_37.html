<h2>Soybean-BioCro model definition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Initial values, parameters, direct modules, differential modules, and
a differential equation solver that can be used to run soybean growth
simulations in Champaign, Illinois and other locations. Along with the soybean
circadian clock specifications (<code>soybean_clock</code>), these values
define the soybean growth model of Matthews <em>et al.</em> (2022)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032">doi:10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032</a>], which is commonly referred to as
<em>Soybean-BioCro</em>.
</p>
<p>To represent soybean growth in Champaign, IL, these values must be paired with
the Champaign weather data (<code>cmi_soybean_weather_data</code>). This
weather data includes the output from the soybean circadian clock model
(<code>soybean_clock</code>), so the clock components do not need to be
included when running a soybean growth simulation using this weather data.
The parameters already include the <code>clay_loam</code> values from the
<code>soil_parameters</code> dataset, which is the appropriate soil type for
Champaign.
</p>
<p>Some specifications, such as the values of photosynthetic parameters, would
remain the same in any location; others, such as the latitude or longitude,
would need to change when simulating crop growth in different locations. Care
must be taken to understand each input quantity before attempting to run
simulations in other places or for other cultivars.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>As improvements are made to the BioCro modules, their behavior changes, and
the soybean model parameters must be updated. Following significant module
updates, reparameterization is performed using the same method and data as
used in Matthews <em>et al.</em> (2022). The following is a summary of
reparameterizations that have occurred since the original publication of the
Soybean-BioCro model:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>2023-06-18</em>: Several modules have been updated, and the value of
the atmospheric transmittance has been changed from 0.85 to 0.6 based on
Campbell and Norman, An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics,
2nd Edition, Pg 173. Due to these changes, reparameterization of the
following was required: <code>alphaLeaf</code>, <code>alphaRoot</code>,
<code>alphaStem</code>, <code>alphaShell</code>, <code>betaLeaf</code>, <code>betaRoot</code>,
<code>betaStem</code>, <code>betaShell</code>, <code>rateSeneLeaf</code>, <code>rateSeneStem</code>,
<code>alphaSeneLeaf</code>, <code>betaSeneLeaf</code>, <code>alphaSeneStem</code>, and
<code>betaSeneStem</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>2023-03-15</em>: Several modules have been updated. The most
significant changes are that (1) the
<code>BioCro:no_leaf_resp_neg_assim_partitioning_growth_calculator</code> now
reduces the leaf growth rate in response to water stress and (2) the
partitioning modules now include a new tissue type (<code>shell</code>). The new
component allows us to distinguish between components of the soybean pod,
where <code>shell</code> represents the pericarp and <code>grain</code> represents the
seed. This distinction has been found to be important for accurately
predicting seed biomass, which is more important in agricultural settings
than the entire pod mass, since the pericarp is not included in typical
yield measurements. Due to these changes, reparameterization of the
following was required: <code>alphaLeaf</code>, <code>alphaRoot</code>,
<code>alphaStem</code>, <code>alphaShell</code>, <code>betaLeaf</code>, <code>betaRoot</code>,
<code>betaStem</code>, <code>betaShell</code>, <code>rateSeneLeaf</code>, <code>rateSeneStem</code>,
<code>alphaSeneLeaf</code>, <code>betaSeneLeaf</code>, <code>alphaSeneStem</code>, and
<code>betaSeneStem</code>. It was also necessary to add a new direct module to the
model definition: <code>BioCro:leaf_water_stress_exponential</code>. This module
calculates the fractional reduction in leaf growth rate due to water stress.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a reparameterization is made, this list should be updated, and any
vignettes using the soybean model should be checked to see if any axis limits,
etc., need to change.

<p>This model is described in detail in Matthews <em>et al.</em> (2022)
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032">doi:10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032</a>]. Here we make a few notes about some of
its components:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For this model, the ODE solver type should not be
<code>boost_rosenbrock</code> or <code>auto</code> (which defaults to
<code>boost_rosenbrock</code> when a fixed step size Euler ODE solver is not
required, as in this case) since the integration will fail unless the
tolerances are stringent (e.g., <code>output_step_size = 0.01</code>,
<code>adaptive_rel_error_tol = 1e-9</code>, <code>adaptive_abs_error_tol = 1e-9</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the initial total seed mass per land area, we use the following
equation: <code>Number of seeds per meter * weight per seed / row spacing</code>.
The number of seeds per meter is 20 and the row spacing is 0.38 m, as
reported in Morgan <em>et al.</em> (2004) [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.104.043968">doi:10.1104/pp.104.043968</a>]. The
weight per seed is based on the average of .12 to .18 grams, as reported by
<a href="https://www.feedipedia.org/node/42">Feedipedia</a>. Thus, we have an
initial biomass of
<code>(20 seeds / m) * (0.15 g / seed) / (0.38 m) = 7.89 g / m^2</code>,
equivalent to <code>0.0789 Mg / ha</code> in the typical BioCro units. Since this
model does not have a seed component, this value is used to determine the
initial <code>Leaf</code>, <code>Stem</code>, and <code>Root</code> biomass, assuming 80%
leaf, 10% stem, and 10% root.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For historical reasons, the seed tissue in this model is called
<code>Grain</code>. The entire pod biomass can be calculated by adding the
<code>Grain</code> and <code>Shell</code> biomass.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For historical reasons, this model includes a <code>Rhizome</code> tissue.
Soybean does not have a rhizome, so the rhizome in the model does not grow
or senesce. To achieve this, the <code>kRhizome_emr</code> and
<code>rateSeneRhizome</code> parameters must be set to 0. It is also necessary to
specify values for several other quantities such as <code>alphaSeneRhizome</code>,
<code>betaSeneRhizome</code>, and the initial rhizome mass, although the actual
values of these quantities will have no effect on the simulation output.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For historical reasons, some of the modules that define Soybean-BioCro
require input quantities that are not actually used for any calculations;
these "extraneous" parameters are identified in <code>data/soybean.R</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>sowing_time</code> input to the
<code>soybean_development_rate_calculator</code> module is set to 0 because
Soybean-BioCro uses the weather data to set the sowing time. In other words,
the weather data is truncated so it begins at the sowing date.
