A data set used in example of <code>recur.bart</code>. 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A matrix containing a 20% random sample of the testing set for a real data
example of recurrent events survival analysis.  There are 100 patients in
the cohort: 50 in the training set and 50 in the testing set.  See the
Reference below (and the References therein) for more detailed
information; a brief synopsis follows.
</p>
<p><code>xdm20.test</code> contains both the training set and the testing set.
There are 798 unique time points so there are 50*798=39900 rows of the
training set followed by 50*798=39900 rows of the testing set.  For
patient's who died prior to the end of follow-up, their external factors
are last value carried forward.  Therefore, we can use <code>xdm20.test</code>
to estimate the cumulative hazard for all patients for all time points.
</p>
<p>The full data set, <code>xdm.test</code>, can be obtained online at

There are 488 patients in the full cohort: 235 in the training set and 253 in
the testing set.  
</p>
<p><code>xdm.test</code> contains both the training set and the testing set.
There are 798 unique time points so there are 235*798=187530 rows of the
training set followed by 253*798=201894 rows of the testing set.  For
patient's who died prior to the end of follow-up, their external factors
are last value carried forward.
