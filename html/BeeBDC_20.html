<h2>Identifies duplicate occurrence records</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses user-specified inputs and columns to identify duplicate occurrence records.
Duplicates are identified iteratively and will be tallied up, duplicate pairs clustered, and
sorted at the end of the function.
The function is designed to work with Darwin Core data with a database_id column,
but it is also modifiable to work with other columns.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dupeSummary(
  data = NULL,
  path = NULL,
  duplicatedBy = NULL,
  completeness_cols = NULL,
  idColumns = NULL,
  collectionCols = NULL,
  collectInfoColumns = NULL,
  CustomComparisonsRAW = NULL,
  CustomComparisons = NULL,
  sourceOrder = NULL,
  prefixOrder = NULL,
  dontFilterThese = c(".gridSummary", ".lonFlag", ".latFlag", ".uncer_terms",
    ".uncertaintyThreshold", ".unLicensed"),
  characterThreshold = 2,
  numberThreshold = 3,
  numberOnlyThreshold = 5,
  catalogSwitch = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame or tibble. Occurrence records as input.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character path to the location where the duplicateRun_ file will be saved.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>duplicatedBy</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. Options are c("ID", "collectionInfo", "both"). "ID"
columns runs through a series of ID-only columns defined by idColumns. "collectionInfo" runs
through a series of columns defined by collectInfoColumns, which are checked in combination
with collectionCols. "both" runs both of the above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>completeness_cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. A set of columns that are used to order and select
duplicates by. For each occurrence, this function will calculate the sum of <code>complete.cases()</code>.
Within duplicate clusters occurrences with a greater number of the completeness_cols filled
in will be kept over those with fewer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>idColumns</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. The columns to be checked individually for internal
duplicates. Intended for use with ID columns only.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>collectionCols</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. The columns to be checked in combination with each
of the completeness_cols.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>collectInfoColumns</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. The columns to be checked in combinatino with
all of the collectionCols columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CustomComparisonsRAW</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of character vectors. Custom comparisons - as a list of
columns to iteratively compare for duplicates. These differ from the CustomComparisons in
that they ignore the minimum number and character thresholds for IDs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CustomComparisons</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of character vectors. Custom comparisons - as a list of
columns to iteratively compare for duplicates. These comparisons are made after character
and number thresholds are accounted for in ID columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sourceOrder</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. The order in which you want to KEEP duplicated
based on the dataSource column (i.e. what order to prioritize data sources).
NOTE: These dataSources are simplified to the string prior
to the first "_". Hence, "GBIF_Anthophyla" becomes "GBIF."</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prefixOrder</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. Like sourceOrder, except based on the database_id prefix,
rather than the dataSource. Additionally, this is only examined if prefixOrder != NULL.
Default = NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dontFilterThese</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. This should contain the flag columns to be ignored
in the creation or updating of the .summary column. Passed to  <code>summaryFun()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>characterThreshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The complexity threshold for ID letter length. This is the
minimum number of characters that need to be present in ADDITION TO the numberThreshold for an
ID number to be tested for duplicates. Ignored by CustomComparisonsRAW. The columns that are
checked are occurrenceID, recordId, id, catalogNumber, and otherCatalogNumbers. Default = 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numberThreshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The complexity threshold for ID number length. This is the
minimum number of numeric characters that need to be present in ADDITION TO the
characterThreshold for an ID number to be tested for duplicates. Ignored by
CustomComparisonsRAW. The columns that are checked are occurrenceID, recordId, id,
catalogNumber, and otherCatalogNumbers. Default = 3.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numberOnlyThreshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. As numberThreshold except the characterThreshold is ignored.
Default = 5.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>catalogSwitch</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If TRUE, and the catalogNumber is empty the function will copy over
the otherCatalogNumbers into catalogNumber and visa versa. Hence, the function will attempt
to matchmore catalog numbers as both of these functions can be problematic. Default = TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns data with an additional column called .duplicates where FALSE occurrences are
duplicates and TRUE occurrences are either kept duplicates or unique. Also exports a .csv to
the user-specified location with information about duplicate matching. This file is used by
other functions including
<code>manualOutlierFindeR()</code> and <code>chordDiagramR()</code>
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>chordDiagramR()</code> for creating a chord diagram to visualise linkages between
dataSources and <code>dupePlotR()</code> to visualise the numbers and proportions of duplicates in
each dataSource.
