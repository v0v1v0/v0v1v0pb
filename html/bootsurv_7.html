<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains multiple datasets described below.
</p>


<h3>Datasets</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>data_pop</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a population of size 6,000. This data set contains a column of generated study variable, labeled as <code>study.variable</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data_pop_st</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This dataset represents a population of size 17,800, divided into 5 strata. It includes a column for the generated study variable, labeled as <code>study.variable</code>, and a column identifying the strata, labeled as <code>stratum</code>. The subpopulation sizes within each stratum are as follows: 4,500, 6,300, 3,500, 2,000, and 1,500, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data_pop_clust</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This dataset represents a population consisting of 10,048 units distributed across 200 clusters. The number of units within each cluster was generated using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 50. It includes columns for the generated study variable, labeled as <code>study.variable</code>, and cluster identification, denoted as <code>cluster</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data_pop_stclust</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This dataset represents a population with 14,511 units distributed across three strata, consisting of 100, 125, and 65 clusters, respectively. The number of units within each cluster was generated using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 50. It includes columns of the generated study variable, labeled as <code>study.variable</code>, stratum identification, labeled as <code>stratum</code>, and cluster identification within each stratum, labeled as <code>cluster</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data_samp_srs</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This dataset comprises a sample of size 1,850, obtained through simple random sampling without replacement from the <code>data_pop</code> dataset.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data_samp_stsrs</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This dataset represents a sample of size 5,350 obtained through stratified simple random sampling without replacement from the stratified population <code>data_pop_st</code>. The sample consists of subsample sizes of 1,350, 1,900, 1,050, 600, and 450.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data_samp_clust</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This sample was drawn using a two-stage cluster sampling method, with simple random sampling without replacement applied at each stage. The sample is drawn from the <code>data_pop_clust</code> dataset. In the first stage, approximately 20% of clusters were selected. Subsequently, within each selected cluster, approximately 15% of units were sampled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data_samp_stclust</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A stratified two-stage cluster sampling method is applied to draw this sample from the <code>data_pop_stclust</code> dataset. In each stratum, simple random sampling without replacement is applied at each stage. The first stage sampling fraction is approximately 20%, and the overall second stage sampling is approximately 15%.</p>
