<h2>Functional mean from EEG dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is based on (Fisher et al., 2014), which uses as an example a subset of the electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) (Quan et al. 1997). Since we cannot publish the EEG recordings from SHHS participants in this package, we instead include the summary statistics of the PCs from our subsample of the processed SHHS EEG data. These summary statistics were generated from measurements of smoothed Normalized Delta Power. This data is used by the <code>simEEG</code> to simulate data examples to demonstrate our functions.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Specifically, <code>EEG_mu</code> is a vector containing the mean normalized delta power function across all subjects, for the first 7.5 hours of sleep.
