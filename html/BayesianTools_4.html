<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package with general-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers,  as well as plots and diagnostic functions for Bayesian statistics
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A package with  general-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers, as well as plots and diagnostic functions for Bayesian statistics, particularly for process-based models.
</p>
<p>The package contains 2 central functions, <code>createBayesianSetup</code>, which creates a standardized Bayesian setup with likelihood and priors, and <code>runMCMC</code>, which allows to run various MCMC and SMC samplers.
</p>
<p>The package can of course also be used for general (non-Bayesian) target functions.
</p>
<p>To use the package, a first step is to use <code>createBayesianSetup</code> to create a BayesianSetup, which usually contains prior and likelihood densities, or in general a target function.
</p>
<p>Those can be sampled with <code>runMCMC</code>, which can call a number of general purpose Metropolis sampler, including the <code>Metropolis</code> that allows to specify various popular Metropolis variants such as adaptive and/or delayed rejection Metropolis; two variants of differential evolution MCMC <code>DE</code>, <code>DEzs</code>, two variants of DREAM  <code>DREAM</code> and <code>DREAMzs</code>, the <code>Twalk</code> MCMC, and a Sequential Monte Carlo sampler <code>smcSampler</code>.
</p>
<p>The output of runMCMC is of class mcmcSampler / smcSampler if one run is performed, or mcmcSamplerList / smcSamplerList if several sampler are run. Various functions are available for plotting, model comparison (DIC, marginal likelihood), or to use the output as a new prior.
