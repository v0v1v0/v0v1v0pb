<h2>Discrete donation data summary</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains a recency-frequency matrix capturing the discrete
transaction behavior of 11,104 customers over 6 transaction opportunities,
summarized as a recency-frequency matrix and a vector of annual transactions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(donationsSummary)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A named list:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>$rf.matrix</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with 22 rows (for each possible
recency-frequency combination in 6 calibration period transaction
opportunities) and 4 columns: number of transactions during the calibration
period ("x"), recency in the calibration period ("t.x"), number of
transaction opportunities in the calibration period ("n.cal"), and number
of customers with this recency-frequency combination in the calibration
period ("custs").</p>
</dd>
<dt>$rf.matrix.holdout</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with 15 rows (for each possible
recency-frequency combination in 5 holdout period transaction
opportunities) and 4 columns: number of transactions during the holdout
period ("x.star"), recency in the holdout period ("t.x.star"), number of
transaction opportunities in the holdout period ("n.star"), and number of
customers with the recency-frequency combination in the holdout period
("custs").</p>
</dd>
<dt>$x.star</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector with 22 elements, containing the number
of transactions made by each calibration period recency-frequency bin in
the holdout period. It is in the same order as <code>$rf.matrix.</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>$annual.sales</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector with 11 elements, containing the number of
transactions made by all customers in each time period in both the
calibration and holdout periods.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data from "a major nonprofit organization located in the midwestern United
States that is funded in large part by donations from individuals. In 1995
the organization "acquired" 11,104 first-time supporters; in each of the
following six years, these individuals either did or did not support the
organization."
</p>
<p>This dataset contains, for each possible in-sample recency/frequency
combination in the 1995 cohort, the number of customers and the number of
transactions they made during the validation period.
