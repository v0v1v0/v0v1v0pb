<h2>
Produces QQ-plots of model residuals and of random normal samples
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function produces 9 QQ-Plots. One is for the residuals of a model.
8 of them are for a simulated sample of equal size as the first one but simulated from a normal distribution using rnorm.
The QQ-plot for the residuals is placed at a random place within the 9 plots. If you immediately can 
find the QQ-Plot of the residuals, these may not be normally distributed.
The place of residuals is printed to the R-console.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compareqqnorm(mod)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mod</code></td>
<td>
<p>a linear model (an lm-object or any other object of which resid(mod) 
gives a numeric vector of numbers) 
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a plot is produced and a number if given which indicates the position of the 
residuals (1-3 corresponds to the first row, 4-6 to the second row and
7-9 to the third row)
