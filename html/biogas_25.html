Setup Details for Batch Reactors

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Description of reactor substrates and information on bottle, substrates, inoculum initial masses, and headspace volume for 18 anaerobic bottles with primary wastewater sludge for substrate.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("sludgeTwoSetup")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 18 observations on the following 5 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>identification code, a unique value for each bottle in the dataset. Numeric with all values within a range of 1-21.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>descrip</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>treatment of the substrate (primary wastewater sludge), a character.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>vol.hs</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>bottle headspace volume, in mL. A numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>m.inoc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>mass of inoculum added to the bottle at the start in g, a numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>m.sub.vs</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> mass of volatile solids (VS) of substrate added to the reactor at the start in g, a numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are meant to be example data for <code>summBg</code>.
Substrate was primary wastewater sludge.
</p>
<p>BMP test were carried out in 160 mL serum bottles sealed with a butyl rubber septum retained with an aluminum crimp seal at mesophilic conditions (37 degrees C). 
All bottles contained inoculum and the amount of primary sludge required to achieve an inoculum-to-substrate ratio (ISR) of 2 (VS basis). 
Bottles containing only inoculum (blanks) were used to correct for the background CH4 potential of the inoculum (endogenous CH4 production). 
</p>
<p>Data in <code>sludgeTwoBiogas</code> and <code>sludgeTwoSetup</code> are from the same batch bottles.
