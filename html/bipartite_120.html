<h2> Null model with constrained connectance and moderately constrained marginal totals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>  Implements Diego Vazquez proposal of a null model for pollination networks </p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p> Number of desired null model webs. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>web</code></td>
<td>
<p> An interaction matrix.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function produces a null model network with the main constraint of a connectance that is the same as in the original network. In the process of producing this null model, marginal totals will turn out to be different from the original network, less so for large, dense webs than for small, sparse webs. <code>vaznull</code> is our implementation of the algorithm proposed by Diego Vazquez, hence its name.
<code>vaznull</code> differs from <code>swap.web</code> in that marginal totals are not strictly constrained! The algorithm used as well as the null model it outputs are different. 
</p>
<p>The algorithm was described as follows:
"The algorithm randomized the total number of individual interactions observed in the original interaction matrix, F. To this end, the algorithm first created a binary matrix, assigning interspecific  interactions  according  to  species-specific probabilities, requiring that each species had at least one interaction. As in Vazquez et al. (2005b), the species-specific probabilities were proportional to species' relative  abundances  (probabilities  are  in  fact  approximately proportional and not equal to relative abundances because of the requirement that each species receives at  least one interaction; this requirement causes probabilities to deviate from relative abundances, especially for rare  species).  Once  the  number  of  filled  cells  in  the original matrix was reached, the remaining interactions were  distributed  among  the  filled  cells,  so  that  connectance in the original and randomized matrices was the same." (Vazquez et al. 2007, page 1122-1123).
