<h2>Arctic lake sediment samples of different water depth</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sand, silt and clay compositions of 39 sediment samples of different water 
depth in an Arctic lake.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>


<p><code>ArcticLake$depth</code>: water depth (in meters). 
</p>
<p><code>ArcticLake$x</code>: compositions of three covariates: sand, silt, and clay.

</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Sand, silt and clay compositions of 39 sediment samples at different water 
depth (in meters) in an Arctic lake. The additional feature is a concomitant variable or 
covariate, water depth, which may account for some of the variation in the compositions. 
In statistical terminology, we have a multivariate regression problem with sediment 
composition as predictors and water depth as a response. All row percentage sums to 100, 
except for rounding errors.
