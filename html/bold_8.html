<h2>Search for matches to sequences against the BOLD COI database.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Search for matches to sequences against the BOLD COI database.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bold_identify(
  sequences,
  db = c("COX1", "COX1_SPECIES", "COX1_SPECIES_PUBLIC", "COX1_L640bp"),
  response = FALSE,
  keepSeq = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sequences</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) A vector or list of sequences to identify.
Required. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>db</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) The database to match against, one of COX1 (default),
COX1_SPECIES, COX1_SPECIES_PUBLIC, OR COX1_L640bp. See Details for
more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>response</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) Note that response is the object that returns
from the Curl call, useful for debugging, and getting detailed info on
the API call.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keepSeq</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) If TRUE (default), returns each data.frame
with an attribute 'sequence' containing sequence used to get those results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further args passed on to <code>verb-GET</code>, main
purpose being curl debugging</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>BOLD only allows one sequences per query. We internally
<code>lapply</code> over the input values given to the sequences'
parameter to search with one sequences per query. Remember this if you have a
lot of sequences - you are doing a separate query for each one, so it can
take a long time - if you run into errors let us know.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame or  list of (one per sequences) with the top specimen
matches (up to 100) and their details. If the query fails, returns <code>NULL</code>.
Each data.frame has the attributes <code>sequence</code> with the provided
sequence to match (unless keepSeq is set to FALSE) and <code>errors</code> with the
error message given from a failed request.
</p>


<h3>db parmeter options</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> COX1 Every COI barcode record on BOLD with a minimum sequences
length of 500bp (warning: unvalidated library and includes records without
species level identification). This includes many species represented by
only one or two specimens as well as all species with interim taxonomy. This
search only returns a list of the nearest matches and does not provide a
probability of placement to a taxon.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> COX1_SPECIES Every COI barcode record with a species level
identification and a minimum sequences length of 500bp. This includes
many species represented by only one or two specimens as well as  all
species with interim taxonomy.
Note : Sometimes it does return matches that don't have a species level
identification. Will be checking with BOLD.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> COX1_SPECIES_PUBLIC All published COI records from BOLD and GenBank
with a minimum sequences length of 500bp. This library is a collection of
records from the published projects section of BOLD.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> OR COX1_L640bp Subset of the Species library with a minimum sequences
length of 640bp and containing both public and private records. This library
is intended for short sequences identification as it provides maximum overlap
with short reads from the barcode region of COI.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Named outputs</h3>

<p>For a named output list, make sure to pass in a named list or vector to the
<code>sequences</code> parameter. You can use <code>names&lt;-</code> or
<code>setNames</code> to set names on a list or vector of sequences.
