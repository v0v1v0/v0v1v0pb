<h2>Dataset for PCC process for Normal with both parameters unknown
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) dataset is a data frame that contains two columns. The first column (aPTT_current) repsesents 30 sequentially gathered current observations from the daily routine of a medical laboratory. The values refer to the activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), measured in seconds. The second column (aPTT_historical) refers to 30 historical In Control measurements of the same variable. APTT is a blood test that characterizes coagulation of the blood. More specifically, it is the time that until the coagulation when reagents are added to plasma.
