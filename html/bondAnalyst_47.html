<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The method  <code>pricingWithSptSeq()</code> is developed to compute the Price of Bond using Sequences of the Spot Rates. So,  <code>pricingWithSptSeq()</code> gives the Price of Bond using two different series or sequences of Spot Rates for values passed to its five arguments. Here <code>cpns</code> represents the dollar values of all the coupon payments,<code>sp</code> is a vector of spot rates, <code>t</code> is a vector of number of years ranging from 1 to any specified number of years till maturity, <code>mv</code> is Maturity Value, and <code>n</code> is number of years till maturity. The output is rounded off to three decimal places. The given examples show various ways in which the arguments can be passed to <code>pricingWithSptSeq()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Input values to five arguments  <code>cpns</code> , <code>sp</code>,<code>t</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>n</code>.
