<h2>ECE dataset for the PCC process for Poisson with rate parameter unknown
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Electrical Complex Equipment (ECE) dataset repsesents 25 paired observations in a data frame. The first column (defect_counts) refers the number of defects per inspected number of units, encountered in a complex electrical equipment of an assembly line. The second column (inspected_units) contains the corresponding inspected number of units for the counting of defects. The data were also analyzed by Hansen and Ghare (1987) and Bayarri and Garcia-Donato (2005).</p>
