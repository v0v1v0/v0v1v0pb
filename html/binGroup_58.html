<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>algorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string defining the group testing algorithm to be used.
Non-informative testing options include two-stage hierarchical ("<kbd>D2</kbd>"),
three-stage hierarchical ("<kbd>D3</kbd>"), square array testing without master 
pooling ("<kbd>A2</kbd>"), and square array testing without master pooling ("<kbd>A2M</kbd>").

set of probabilities. Either <kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>probabilities</kbd> should be specified, 
but not both.</p>

(a linear combination of the expected number of tests, the number of 
misclassified negatives, and the number of misclassified positives, 
described in Graff &amp; Roeloffs (1972)). See Hitt et al. (2018) at

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function finds the OTC and computes the
associated operating characteristics for standard group testing algorithms,
as described in Hitt et al. (2018) at 
<a href="http://chrisbilder.com/grouptesting">http://chrisbilder.com/grouptesting</a>.
</p>
<p>Available algorithms include two- and three-stage hierarchical testing and
array testing with and without master pooling. Both non-informative and informative
group testing settings are allowed for each algorithm, except informative 
array testing with master pooling is unavailable because this method has not 
appeared in the group testing literature. Operating characteristics calculated are
expected number of tests, pooling sensitivity, pooling specificity, pooling
positive predictive value, and pooling negative predictive value for each individual.
</p>
<p>The value(s) specified by <kbd>group.sz</kbd> represent the initial (stage 1) 
group size for three-stage hierarchical testing and non-informative 
two-stage hierarchical testing. For informative two-stage hierarchical testing, 
the <kbd>group.sz</kbd> specified represents the block size used in the pool-specific
optimal Dorfman (PSOD) method, where the initial group (block) is not
tested. For more details on informative two-stage hierarchical testing 
implemented via the PSOD method, see Hitt et al. (2018) and McMahan et al. (2012a).
For array testing without master pooling, the <kbd>group.sz</kbd> specified
represents the row/column size for initial (stage 1) testing. For array testing 
with master pooling, the <kbd>group.sz</kbd> specified represents the row/column size 
for stage 2 testing. The group size for initial testing is overall array size, 
given by the square of the row/column size.
</p>
<p>If a single value is provided for <kbd>group.sz</kbd> with array testing or
non-informative two-stage hierarchical testing, operating
characteristics will be calculated and no optimization will be performed.
If a single value is provided for <kbd>group.sz</kbd> with three-stage hierarchical or 
informative two-stage hierarchical, the OTC will be  
found over all possible configurations. If a range of group sizes is specified, 
the OTC will be found over all group sizes.
</p>
<p>The displayed pooling sensitivity, pooling specificity, pooling positive 
predictive value, and pooling negative predictive value are weighted 
averages of the corresponding individual accuracy measures for all 
individuals within the initial group for a hierarchical algorithm, or 
within the entire array for an array-based algorithm.
Expressions for these averages are provided in the Supplementary 
Material for Hitt et al. (2018). These expressions are based on accuracy 
definitions given by Altman and Bland (1994a, 1994b).
