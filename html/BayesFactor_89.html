<h2>Hraba and Grant (1970) children's doll preference data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hraba and Grant (1970) describe a replication of Clark and Clark (1947) in which
black and white children from Lincoln, Nebraska were shown dolls that were either black
or white. They were then asked a series of questions, including "Give me the doll that is
a nice doll." This data set contains the frequency of children giving the same-race or different race doll in
response to this question.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns. Rows give doll preference; colums give the
race of the child.
</p>

## chi-square test
## Barely significant with continuity correction

## Bayes factor test (assuming independent binomial sampling plan)
## Very little evidence for the alternative of lack of independence
