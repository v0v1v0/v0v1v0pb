<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Biosensor data have the potential to improve disease control and detection. However,
the analysis of these data under free-living conditions is not feasible with current
statistical techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a new functional
representation of biosensor data, termed the glucodensity, together with a data
analysis framework based on distances between them. The new data analysis procedure
is illustrated through an application in diabetes with continuous-time glucose
monitoring (CGM) data. In this domain, we show marked improvement with respect to
state-of-the-art analysis methods. In particular, our findings demonstrate that (i)
the glucodensity possesses an extraordinary clinical sensitivity to capture the
typical biomarkers used in the standard clinical practice in diabetes; (ii) previous
biomarkers cannot accurately predict glucodensity, so that the latter is a richer
source of information and; (iii) the glucodensity is a natural generalization of the
time in range metric, this being the gold standard in the handling of CGM data.
Furthermore, the new method overcomes many of the drawbacks of time in range metrics
and provides more indepth insight into assessing glucose metabolism.
