<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function implements a variety of the many (and still procreating) indices describing network topography at the group level.
</p>

<p>Note that Bersier et al. (2002) have three levels of values for some of their indices: qualitative (i.e. based on binary networks), quantitative (based on networks with information on the number of interactions observed for each link), and weighted-quantitative (where each species is given a weight according to the number of interactions it has). At present, we implement a mixture of qualitative, quantitative and weighted-quantitative indices and offer the option <span class="option">weighted</span> to compute the weighted-quantitative version of some of them (<span class="option">mean number of links</span>, <span class="option">mean number of shared partners</span>, <span class="option">cluster coefficient</span>, <span class="option">partner diversity</span>, <span class="option">generality / vulnerability</span>). For all others, the mechanics behind the index do not allow a weighted mean to be computed (e.g. the distance-matrix between all species combinations used to compute <span class="option">niche.overlap</span>).
</p>
<p>All indices in this function work with real as well as integer values. 
</p>
<p>Extinction slope works on a repeated random sequence of species extinctions (within one trophic level), and calculates the number of secondary extinctions (in the other level). These values are then averaged (over the <span class="option">nrep</span> runs) and plotted against the number of species exterminated. The proportion still recent (on the y-axis) regressed against the proportion exterminated (on the x-axis) is hence standardised to values between 0 and 1 each. Through this plot, a hyperbolic regression is fitted, and the slope of this regression line is returned as an index of extinction sensitivity. The larger the slope, the later the extinction takes its toll on the other trophic level, and hence the higher the redundancy in the trophic level under consideration. Using <span class="option">plot.it=F</span> also returns the graphs (set history to recording in the plotting window). Changing the <span class="option">extinctionmethod</span> to “abundance” will always result in the same sequence (by increasing abundance) and hence does not require replication.
</p>
<p>Most indices are straightforward, one-line formulae; some, such as betweenness, also require a re-arranging of the matrix; and one, secondary extinction slope, internally requires iterative runs, making the function relatively slow. If you are not interested in the secondary extinction slopes, simply set <span class="option">nrep=1</span> to make it much faster.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The suffixes LL and HL refer to lower and higher level, respectively. If values for both levels are requested, those for the higher level are given first, followed immediately by those for the lower level.
</p>
<p>Depending on the selected indices, some or all of the below (returned as vector if “degree distribution” was not requested, otherwise as list):
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mean number of species</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>sic</em>, possibly weighted (if <span class="option">weighted=TRUE</span>; the weighted mean is not something typically reported, but it seems a very plausible way to embrace the uncertainty introduced by species with very few interactions).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mean number of links</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>sic</em> (sum of links for each species, averaged over all species in that level), possibly weighted (if <span class="option">weighted=TRUE</span>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mean number of shared partners</code></td>
<td>
<p>Based on the distance matrix between species, counting the number of species in the other level that both interact with; based on Roberts &amp; Stone (1990) and Stone &amp; Roberts (1992), i.e. for pollinators will yield mean number of plants shared by any two pollinators (Cannot be weighted.)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cluster coefficient</code></td>
<td>
<p>The cluster coefficient for a level is the (weighted) average cluster coefficients of its members. The cluster coefficient for each species, in turn, is simply the number of realised links divided by the number of possible links. Introduced by Watts &amp; Strogatz (1998) and described in Wikipedia under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clustering_coefficient">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clustering_coefficient</a>. If you want to use Tore Opsahl's adaptation to two-modes, please see the next index, based on his function <code>clustering_tm</code> in <span class="pkg">tnet</span>. To my knowledge, so far every study has used the “wrong” one, i.e. the one presented here as <span class="option">cluster coefficient</span>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weighted cluster coefficient</code></td>
<td>
<p>When asking for “weighted cluster coefficient”, this version will automatically use interactions as weights unless the data are binary. The computation is based on <code>clustering_tm</code> in <span class="pkg">tnet</span>. See there (and more on Tore Opsahl's webpages) for help.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>niche overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean similarity in interaction pattern between species of that level, calculated by default as Horn's index (use <span class="option">dist</span> to change this.). Values near 0 indicate no common use of niches, 1 indicates perfect niche overlap.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>togetherness</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean number of co-occupancies across all species-combinations; the whole matrix is scanned for submatrices of the form (0,0,1,1), representing perfect matches of co-presences and co-absences. These are counted for each pairwise species combination, and averaged (without weighting). Since the number of species differs between the levels, the same number of co-occupancies will lead to different togetherness-values for the two levels. Based on Stone &amp; Roberts (1992).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C score</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Normalised) mean number of checkerboard combinations across all species of the level. Values close to 1 indicate that there is evidence for disaggregation, e.g. through competition. Value close to 0 indicate aggregation of species (i.e. no repelling forces between species). Since the number of species differs between the levels, the same number of checkerboard patterns will lead to different C-scores for the two levels. See Stone and Roberts (1990) for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>V ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p>Variance-ratio of species numbers to interaction numbers within species of a level. Values larger than 1 indicate positive aggregation, values between 0 and 1 indicate disaggregation of species. See Schluter (1984) for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>discrepancy</code></td>
<td>
<p>Discrepancy as proposed by Brualdi &amp; Sanderson (1999); see <code>discrepancy</code> for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>degree distribution</code></td>
<td>
<p>Coefficients and fits for three different functions to a level's degree distributions: exponential, power law and truncated power law. See <code>degreedistr</code> for details and references.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extinction slope</code></td>
<td>
<p>Slope of the secondary extinction sequence in one level, following extermination of species in the other level; <code>extinction slope.HL</code> refers to the robustness of the higher level to extinctions in the lower level (and vice versa); see <code>slope.bipartite</code> and <code>second.extinct</code> for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>robustness</code></td>
<td>
<p>Calculates the area below the “secondary extinction” curve; <code>robustness.HL</code> refers to the robustness of the higher level to extinctions in the lower level (and vice versa); see <code>robustness</code> for details. Corresponds to “extinction slope”.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>functional complementarity</code></td>
<td>
<p>“Functional complementarity” for a given level. This measure of niche complementarity (as described by Devoto et al. 2012), is computed as the total branch length of a “functional dendrogram” based on qualitative differences of interactions of one level with the other. Thus, the “functional” aspect of functional complementarity refers to the function of sharing interactions. Should be highly correlated with niche overlap, only binary.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>partner diversity</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Weighted) mean Shannon diversity of the number of interactions for the species of that level. Choose <span class="option">logbase=2</span> to change to a log2-based version.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>generality/vulnerability</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Weighted) mean effective number of LL species per HL species (generality; HL species per LL species for vulnerability), weighted by their marginal totals (row sums); see Tylianakis et al. (2007) and Bersier et al. (2002). This is identical to exp(“partner diversity”, i.e., simply the Jost (2006)-recommended version of diversity.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If your web returns and NA for some of the indices, this can be because the index cannot be computed. For example, if the web is full (i.e. no 0-cells), extinction slopes cannot be fitted (singularity of gradient). Check if you can expect the index to be computable! If it is, and <code>grouplevel</code> doesn't do it, let me know.
</p>
<p>Some indices require rather long computation times on large webs. If you want to increase the speed by omitting some indices, here a rough guide: Ask only for the indices you are interested in! Otherwise, here is the sequence of most time-consuming indices: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> For somewhat larger networks (i.e. more than 2 dozen species per level), <span class="option">weighted cluster coefficient</span> is <em>very</em> time consuming (an exhaustive search for 4-loops in the one-mode projection of the network). Omitting it can dramatically boost speed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Typically, the slowest function is related to extinction slopes and robustness. Excluding <em>both</em> makes the function faster. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Degree distributions are somewhat time consuming. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
