<h2>
Get state transitions between a state and its attractor
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lists the states in the path from a specified state to the corresponding synchronous attractor.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getPathToAttractor(network, 
                   state,
                   includeAttractorStates = c("all","first","none"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a network structure of class <code>BooleanNetwork</code> or <code>SymbolicBooleanNetwork</code> , or an attractor search result of class <code>AttractorInfo</code>. In the former case, a synchronous attractor search starting from <code>state</code> is conducted. In the latter case, <code>network</code> must be the result of a call to <code>getAttractors</code> with <code>returnTable=TRUE</code>, and its transition table must include <code>state</code>.    
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>state</code></td>
<td>

<p>A binary vector with exactly one entry per gene in the network. If <code>network</code> is of class <code>SymbolicBooleanNetwork</code> and makes use of more than one predecessor state, this can also be a matrix with the genes in the columns and multiple predecessor states in the rows.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>includeAttractorStates</code></td>
<td>

<p>Specifies whether the actual attractor states are included in the resulting table or not. If <code>includeAttractorStates = "all"</code> (which is the default behaviour), the sequence ends when the attractor was traversed once. If <code>includeAttractorStates = "first"</code>, only the first state of attractor is added to the sequence. This corresponds to the behaviour prior to <span class="pkg">BoolNet</span> version 1.5. If includeAttractorStates = "none", the sequence ends with the last non-attractor state. In this case, the sequence can be empty if the start state is an attractor state.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame with the genes in the columns. The rows are the successive states from <code>state</code> to the  the corresponding attractor. Depending on <code>includeAttractorStates</code>, attractor states are included or not. The data frame has an attribute <code>attractor</code> specifying the indices of the states that belong to the attractor. If <code>includeAttractorStates</code> is <code>"first"</code> or <code>"none"</code>, these indices may correspond to states that are not included in the sequence itself. This attribute is used by <code>plotSequence</code> to highlight the attractor states.
