Statistical Methods for Group Testing.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides methods for estimation and hypothesis testing of proportions in group testing designs. It involves methods for estimating a proportion in a single population (assuming sensitivity and specificity 1 in designs with equal group sizes), as well as hypothesis tests and functions for experimental design for this situation. For estimating one proportion or the difference of proportions, a number of confidence interval methods are included, which can deal with various different pool sizes. Further, regression methods are implemented for simple pooling and matrix pooling designs. <br><br>
This package also provides methods for identification of positive items in a number of group testing algorithms. Optimal testing configurations can be found for hierarchical and array-based algorithms. Operating characteristics can be calculated for testing configurations across a wide variety of situations.

<p>1) One-sample case
</p>
<p>Methods for calculating confidence intervals for a single population proportion from designs with equal group sizes (as described by Tebbs and Bilder, 2004 and Schaarschmidt, 2007) are implemented in the function <code>bgtCI</code>.
</p>
<p>For the problem of choosing an adequate experimental design in the one-sample case with only one group size, the functions <code>estDesign</code>, <code>sDesign</code>, <code>nDesign</code> implement different iterative approaches, as examplified by Swallow (1985) and Schaarschmidt (2007).
</p>
<p>If a confidence interval for a single proportion shall be calculated based on a design involving groups of different group sizes, a number of methods described by Hepworth (1999) is available in the function <code>pooledBin</code>. The exact method described by Hepworth (1996) is implemented in the function <code>bgtvs</code>.
</p>
<p>2) Two-sample case
</p>
<p>The function <code>pooledBinDiff</code> provides a number of confidence interval methods for estimating the difference of proportions from two independent samples, allowing for groups of different group size (Biggerstaff, 2008).
</p>
<p>3) Regression models
</p>
<p>Two approaches (by Vansteelandt et al., 2000 and Xie, 2001) to estimate parameters of group testing regression models can be applied by calling <code>gtreg</code>. Once fitted, corresponding methods to extract residuals, calculate predictions and summarize the parameter estimates (including hypotheses tests) are available in the S3 methods <code>residuals.gt</code>, <code>predict.gt</code> and <code>summary.gt</code>.
</p>
<p>Group testing regression models in settings with matrix pooling (Xie, 2001) can be fit using <code>gtreg.mp</code>. 
</p>
<p>4) Identification using hierarchical and array-based group testing algorithms
</p>
<p>The function <code>OTC</code> implements a number of group testing algorithms, described in Hitt et al. (2018), which calculate the operating characteristics and find the optimal testing configuration over a range of possible initial pool sizes and/or testing configurations (sets of subsequent pool sizes).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# 1) One-sample problem

# 1.1) Confidence intervals for designs with equal group size (pool size),
# where 
#  n denotes the number of groups (pools),
#  s denotes the common group size (number of individuals pooled per group),
#  y denotes the number of groups tested positive.

# The following call reproduces the example given 
# by Tebbs and Bilder (2004) for the two-sided 95-percent 
# exact (Clopper-Pearson) interval:

bgtCI(n=24, y=3, s=7, conf.level=0.95,
 alternative="two.sided", method="CP")

# 1.2) Confidence intervals for designs with unequal group size (pool size):
# Keeping notation as above but allowing for (a limited number of) different
# group size s, the examples given in Hepworth (1996), Table 5 can be 
# reproduced by calling:

 bgtvs(n=c(2,3), s=c(5,2), y=c(0,0))
 bgtvs(n=c(2,3), s=c(5,2), y=c(0,1))

# The function pooledBin provides different methods for the same problem,
# where x is the number of positive groups, m is the size of the groups and
# n is the number of groups with the correesponding sizes:

pooledBin(x=c(0,1), m=c(5,2), n=c(2,3), ci.method="score")
pooledBin(x=c(0,1), m=c(5,2), n=c(2,3), ci.method="lrt")
pooledBin(x=c(0,1), m=c(5,2), n=c(2,3), ci.method="bc-skew-score")

# 1.3) For experimental design based on the bias of the point estimate,
# as proposed by Swallow (1985): The values in Table 1 (Swallow, 1985),
# p.885 can be reproduced by calling:

estDesign(n=10, smax=100, p.tr=0.001)
estDesign(n=10, smax=100, p.tr=0.01)

# 2) Two-sample comparison

# Assume a design, where pools 5, 1, 1, 30, and 20 pools of size 10, 4, 1, 25, 50, 
# respectively, are used to estimate the prevalence in two populations.
# In population 1, one out of 5 pools with 10 units is positive,
# while in population 2, two out of five pools with 10 units is positive as well as 
# the one pool with only 1 unit.
# The difference of proportions is to be estimated.

# 4) Identification using hierarchical and array-based group testing algorithms

# 4.1) Finding the optimal testing configuration over a range of initial 
# group sizes, using non-informative three-stage hierarchical testing, where

# prevalence of E(p_i) = 0.01 and sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.95.

# This example takes approximately 2.5 minutes to run.
