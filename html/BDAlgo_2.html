<h2>The Bloom Detecting Algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Bloom Detecting Algorithm enables the detection of  blooms within a time series of species abundance and extracts 22 phenological variables.
See details for more information.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BDAlgo(data, threshold=c(4,4), perc_of_peak=0.85, nbr_days=300, date_col= 2,
station_col=1, Sp = c("Sp1", "Sp2"), min_Log = 2, SP_label = c("Species1", "Species2"),
Log=TRUE, PDF=FALSE, saving_path=NULL)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data format required is a simple table with samples as rows and species as columns, with date (dd/mm/yyyy) and station in character. The dates are converted into date format in the algorithm.
</p>
<p>The Bloom Detecting Algorithm detects the bloom of a species within a time series of abundance according to three conditions. But first, the algorithm locate the high and low points of the curves. For each high point, the closest
was considered to be a bloom if:
</p>
<p>   1. The high points were above the value of <code>threshold</code> parameter value, which by default is 4, corresponding to the log10 of 10,000 cells/L. The threshold of 10,000 cells/L was used here as the algorithm was created to fit phytoplankton species. See the reference for more information.
</p>
<p>   2. The low points before and after the high points were inferior to the <code>perc_of_peak</code> of 0.85 (85%) of the high point value. In this case, some humps can be merged, as blooms can sometimes be bimodal.
</p>
<p>   3. The merging of two humps would occur when the value of one of the lowest points did not fit the second condition. The merging of two humps cannot occur if the merging causes the increasing or decreasing phase of the bloom to be greater than <code>nbr_days</code>, by default 300 days.
</p>
<p>These three conditions were necessary as they enabled the extraction of the phenological bloom, which in our case corresponded to HABs. The HAB case study helped us define the hump minimum abundance <code>threshold</code> as well as the amplitude <code>nbr_days</code> and shape <code>perc_of_peak</code>.
</p>
<p><code>Log</code> parameter simply transforms the abundance in log(x+1) as it helps with the large variation in the data value. The <code>min_Log</code> parameter (by default, 2 corresponding to 100 cells/L) was the minimum we fixed for our study.
</p>
<p>The output graphs are time series of your species abundance (grey dots) for each station with the fitted smooth spline (grey line) and confidence interval (grey shaded area).
The colored dots correspond to different timing phenological variables, which need to be in the following order for each bloom detected to confirm the validity of the algorithm fit.
Yellow (DBS) &gt; Turquoise (DMF) &gt; Red (DMA) &gt; Purple (DMM) &gt; Pink (DBE)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The BD_Algo function returns:
</p>
<p> 1. a graph per species and per station.
</p>
<p> 2. a list containing the species (Sp) and for each station the following data:
</p>
<p>- <code>smooth_spline</code>: the results of the smooth spline. See smooth.spline for more information on the return values.
</p>
<p>- <code>conf_intervall</code>:  the data of the confidence intervals.
</p>
<p>- <code>all_date</code>: the character vector with all the dates used in the smooth spline.
</p>
<p>- <code>all_bloom</code>: the phenological data frame of each bloom with the timing variables (DBS, DMF, DMA, DMM, DBE) corrected.
</p>
<p>- <code>all_bloom_date</code>: the raw phenological data frame of each bloom.
</p>
<p>Warnings may occur during the smooth spline applications.
