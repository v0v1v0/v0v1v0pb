<h2>Complete Miscanthus assimilation field data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Assimilation and stomatal conductance in Miscanthus as measured in Beale, Bint, and Long
1996.  (Missing data are also included.)  The first column is
the date, the second the hour. Columns 3 and 4 are assimilation and
stomatal conductance respectively.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame of dimensions 35 by 6.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The third column is the observed net assimilation rate (micromoles m^-2 s^-1).
</p>
<p>The fifth column is the observed quantum flux (micromoles m^-2 s^-1).
</p>
<p>The sixth column is the temperature (degrees Celsius).
