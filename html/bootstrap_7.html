<h2>  Cell Survival data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on cell survival under different radiation 
doses.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(cell)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 14 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>dose</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, unit rads/100 </p>
</dd>
<dt>log.surv</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, (natural) logarithm of proportion</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are regression situations where the covariates are more naturally 
considered 
fixed rather than random. This cell survival data are an example. A 
radiologist has run
an experiment involving 14 bacterial plates. The plates where exposed to 
different 
doses of radiation, and the proportion of surviving cells measured. 
Greater doses lead to
smaller survival proportions, as would be expected. The investigator 
expressed some 
doubt as to the validity of observation 13. 
</p>
<p>So there is some interest as to the influence of observation 13 on the 
conclusions.
</p>
<p>Two different theoretical models as to radiation damage were available, 
one predicting 
a linear regresion, 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\mu_i = \mbox{E}(y_i \vert z_i) = \beta_1 z_i</code>
</p>

<p>and the other predicting a quadratic regression,
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\mu_i = \mbox{E}(y_i \vert z_i) = \beta_1 z_i+\beta_2 z_i^2</code>
</p>

<p>Hypothesis tests on <code class="reqn">\beta_2</code> is of interest.
