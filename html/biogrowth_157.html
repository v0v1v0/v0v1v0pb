<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To ease data input, the functions can convert between parameters defined in different
scales. Namely, for predictions in constant environments (environment="constant"):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "logN0" can be defined as "N0". The function automatically calculates the log-transformation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "logNmax" can be defined as "Nmax". The function automatically calculates the log-transformation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "mu" can be defined as "mu_opt". The function assumes the prediction is under optimal growth conditions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "lambda" can be defined by "Q0". The duration of the lag phase is calculated using <code>Q0_to_lambda()</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, for predictions in dynamic environments (environment="dynamic"):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "N0" can be defined as "N0". The function automatically calculates the antilog-transformation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "Nmax" can be defined as "logNmax". The function automatically calculates the antilog-transformation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "mu" can be defined as "mu_opt". The function assumes mu was calculated under optimal growth conditions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "Q0" can be defined by the value of "lambda" under dynamic conditions. Then, the
value of Q0 is calculated using <code>lambda_to_Q0()</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An instance of GrowthPrediction.
</p>


<h3>Predictions in constant environments</h3>

<p>Predictions under constant environments are calculated using only primary models.
Consequently, the arguments "secondary_models" and "env_conditions" are ignored.
If these were passed, the function would return a warning. In this case,
predictions are calculated using the algebraic form of the primary model (see
vignette for details).
</p>
<p>The growth model is defined through the "primary_model" argument using a named list.
One of the list elements must be named "model" and must take take one of the valid
keys returned by <code>primary_model_data()</code>. The remaining entries of the list define the
values of the parameters of the selected model. A list of valid keys can be retrieved
using <code>primary_model_data()</code> (see example below). Note that the functions can do
some operations to facilitate the compatibility between constant and dynamic environments
(see Details).
</p>


<h3>Predictions in dynamic environments</h3>

<p>Predictions under dynamic environments are calculated by solving numerically
the differential equation of the Baranyi growth model. The effect of
changes in the environmental conditions in the growth rate are calculated
according to the gamma approach. Therefore, one must define both primary
and secondary models.
</p>
<p>The dynamic environmental conditions are defined using a tibble (or data.frame)
through the "env_conditions" argument. It must include one column named "time" stating the elapsed
time and as many additional columns as environmental conditions included in the prediction.
For values of time not included in the tibble, the values of the environmental conditions
are calculated by linear interpolation.
</p>
<p>Primary models are defined as a named list through the "primary_model" argument. It
must include the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> N0: initial population size
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Nmax: maximum population size in the stationary growth phase
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> mu_opt: growth rate under optimal growth conditions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Q0: value defining the duration of the lag phase
Additional details on these parameters can be found in the package vignettes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary models are defined as a nested list through the "secondary_models" argument.
The list must have one entry per environmental condition, whose name must match
those used in the "env_conditions" argument. Each of these entries must be a named list
defining the secondary model for each environmental condition. The model equation is defined
in an entry named "model" (valid keys can be retrieved from <code>secondary_model_data()</code>). Then,
additional entries defined the values of each model parameters (valid keys can be retrieved from <code>secondary_model_data()</code>)
</p>
<p>For additional details on how to define the secondary models, please see the package vignettes (and examples below).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## Example 1 - Growth under constant conditions -----------------------------

## Valid model keys can be retrieved calling primary_model_data()

primary_model_data()

my_model &lt;- "modGompertz"  # we will use the modified-Gompertz

## The keys of the model parameters can also be obtained from primary_model_data()

primary_model_data(my_model)$pars

## We define the primary model as a list

my_model &lt;- list(model = "modGompertz", logN0 = 0, C = 6, mu = .2, lambda = 20)

## We can now make the predictions

my_time &lt;- seq(0, 100, length = 1000)  # Vector of time points for the calculations

my_prediction &lt;- predict_growth(my_time, my_model, environment = "constant")

## The instance of IsothermalGrowth includes several S3 methods 

print(my_prediction)
plot(my_prediction)
coef(my_prediction)

## Example 2 - Growth under dynamic conditions ------------------------------

## We will consider the effect of two factors: temperature and pH

my_conditions &lt;- data.frame(time = c(0, 5, 40),
                            temperature = c(20, 30, 35),
                            pH = c(7, 6.5, 5)
                            )
                            
## The primary model is defined as a named list
                            
my_primary &lt;- list(mu = 2, Nmax = 1e7, N0 = 1, Q0 = 1e-3)

## The secondary model is defined independently for each factor

sec_temperature &lt;- list(model = "Zwietering",
    xmin = 25, xopt = 35, n = 1)

sec_pH = list(model = "CPM",
    xmin = 5.5, xopt = 6.5,
    xmax = 7.5, n = 2)
    
## Then, they are assigned to each factor using a named list

my_secondary &lt;- list(
    temperature = sec_temperature,
    pH = sec_pH
    )
    
## We can call the function now

my_times &lt;- seq(0, 50, length = 1000)  # Where the output is calculated

dynamic_prediction &lt;- predict_growth(environment = "dynamic", 
                                     my_times, my_primary, my_secondary,
                                     my_conditions
                                     )
                                     
## The instance of DynamicGrowth includes several useful S3 methods

print(dynamic_prediction)
plot(dynamic_prediction)
plot(dynamic_prediction, add_factor = "pH")
coef(dynamic_prediction)

## The time_to_size function can predict the time to reach a population size

time_to_size(my_prediction, 3)
