<h2>Binary Generalized Extreme Value Additive Modelling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>bgeva</code> provides a function for univariate modelling for binary rare events data with linear and nonlinear predictor effects when using the quantile function of the Generalized Extreme Value random variable.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>bgeva</code> provides a function for flexible regression models for binary rare events data. The underlying representation and 
estimation of the model is based on a penalized regression spline approach, with automatic smoothness selection. The 
numerical routine carries out function minimization using a trust region algorithm from the package <code>trust</code> in combination with
an adaptation of a low level smoothness selection fitting procedure from the package <code>mgcv</code>. 
</p>
<p><code>bgeva</code> supports the use of many smoothers as extracted from <code>mgcv</code>. Scale invariant tensor product smooths
are not currently supported. Estimation is by penalized maximum likelihood with automatic smoothness selection achieved 
by using the approximate Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE). 
</p>
<p>Confidence intervals for smooth components are derived using a Bayesian approach. Approximate p-values for testing 
individual smooth terms for equality to the zero function are also provided. Functions <code>plot.bgeva</code> and 
<code>summary.bgeva</code> extract such information from a fitted <code>bgevaObject</code>. Variable 
selection is also possible via the use of shrinakge smoothers or information criteria. 
</p>
<p>Consider also using the faster and more stable version implemented in the <code>gamlss()</code> function of the 
<code>SemiParBIVProbit</code> package. <code>gamlss()</code> also allows for a much wider choice of smoothers.
