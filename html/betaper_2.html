<h2> Tree abundance and soil data in Western Amazonia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Amazonia</code> data frame has tree counts in nine 0.16-hectare inventory plots in Western Amazonia. <code>soils</code> contains data on soil
cations at each location.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Amazonia)
data(soils)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>Amazonia</code> is a data frame with 1188 observations (species) and 12 columns (taxonomic descripcion and sites). The three first columns 
refer to family, genus and specific species Latin names. Columns 4 to 12 have tree abundance data for nine inventory plots.
</p>
<p><code>soils</code> is a data frame with 9 observations (inventory plots) and 4 columns (variables). Soil variables (Ca, K, Mg, Na) are given in cmol/kg.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data from Western Amazonia includes tree inventories at nine lowland sites (approximately 100-150 m above sea level) near Iquitos, Peru. 
The sites were selected to represent regional variations in geology and were distributed along a soil nutrient gradient ranging from poor 
loamy soils to richer clayey soils. Each inventory consisted of 20 x 20 m plots (0.16 ha total area) distributed along 1.3-km transects. 
At each site, K. Ruokolainen and colleagues identified to species or morphospecies all woody, free-standing stems of &gt; 2.5 cm dbh. The 
full inventories sampled 3980 individuals from 1188 species or morphospecies.
