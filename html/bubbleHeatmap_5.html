<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The sample data included in this package represents associations between Nightingale
metabolic measures and a genetic risk score (GRS) for Cholesterol Ester Transfer
Protein (CETP) in the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), a prospective study of
Chinese adults from 10 distinct areas of China. The full design of the CKB
cohort and the methods and results of this study have been previously published.
</p>
<p>CETP transfers esterified cholesterol from HDL to apolipoprotein B-containing
lipoproteins in exchange for triglycerides. This process is a key component of
the atheroprotective reverse cholesterol transport pathway, which modulates the
return of excess cholesterol from peripheral cells such as macrophages to the
liver, where it can be redistributed or excreted. Reduced CETP activity results
in higher levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), which has resulted in interest in
CETP as a drug target due to the inverse correlation between HDL-C and risk of
atherosclerotic disease. In this analysis, five CETP SNP variants were selected
on the basis of previously reported associations with HDL cholesterol and CETP
activity. Genotyping data for these variants and conventional lipid biochemistry
measures were available for a subset of 17,854 CKB participants selected for a
CVD case-control study. This data was used to generate a CETP GRS weighted by
HDL-C association, derived internally with 100-fold cross-validation. The
Nightingale Health metabolomics panel consisting of 225 metabolomics measures
was available for 4657 of these individuals, and association with the GRS was
assessed by linear regression with adjustment for age and sex, stratified by
geographical region. In generation of the GRS and association of metabolomics,
outcomes were standardized by rank inverse normal transformation, stratified by
region, after adjustment for age and sex.
