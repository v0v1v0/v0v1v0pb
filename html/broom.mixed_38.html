<h2>Extract standard deviation of "random" effects from an <code>MCMCglmm</code> object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function designed to extract the standard deviation of the
random effects from an <code>MCMCglmm</code> model object.
Note that this is not the same as the posterior distribution of
(co)variance matrices. It is based on the posterior distribution
of the random effects. This also means it requires <code>pr=TRUE</code>
to be set in the model for the information to be saved. Can optionally
return standard deviation of random effects after back transforming to
the response metric. Currently probabilities, but only for ordinal family
models (<code>family="ordinal"</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">stdranef(object, which, type = c("lp", "response"), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>MCMCglmm</code> model object to extract the effects from</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of random effects to extract or their numeric positions
If there are two numbers in a list, effects are simulataneous.</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>A character string indicating whether to calculate the standard
deviation on the linear predictor metric, ‘lp’ or
response, ‘response’.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of class postMCMCglmmRE with means (<code>M</code>) and individual estimates (<code>Data</code>)
