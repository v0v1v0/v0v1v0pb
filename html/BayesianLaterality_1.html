<h2>BayesianLaterality: Predict Brain Asymmetry Based on Handedness and Dichotic Listening</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functional differences between the cerebral hemispheres are a fundamental characteristic of the human brain. Researchers interested in studying these differences often infer underlying hemispheric dominance for a certain function (e.g., language) from laterality indices calculated from observed performance or brain activation measures . However, any inference from observed measures to latent (unobserved) classes has to consider the prior probability of class membership in the population. The provided functions implement a Bayesian model for predicting hemispheric dominance from observed laterality indices (Sorensen and Westerhausen, Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition, 2020, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1357650X.2020.1769124">doi:10.1080/1357650X.2020.1769124</a>).
