<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes the operating characteristics for
group testing algorithms with an assay that tests for one disease, as
described in Hitt et al. (2019).
</p>
<p>Available algorithms include two-, three-, and four-stage hierarchical
testing and array testing with and without master pooling. Both
non-informative and informative group testing settings are allowed for each
algorithm, except informative array testing with master pooling is
unavailable because this method has not appeared in the group testing
literature. Operating characteristics calculated are expected number of
tests, pooling sensitivity, pooling specificity, pooling positive predictive
value, and pooling negative predictive value for each individual.
</p>
<p>For informative algorithms where the <kbd>p</kbd> argument is specified, the
expected value of order statistics from a beta distribution are found.
These values are used to represent disease risk probabilities for each
individual to be tested. The beta distribution has two parameters: a mean
parameter <kbd>p</kbd> (overall disease prevalence) and a shape parameter
<kbd>alpha</kbd> (heterogeneity level). Depending on the specified <kbd>p</kbd>,
<kbd>alpha</kbd>, and overall group size, simulation may be necessary to
generate the vector of individual probabilities. This is done using
<code>expectOrderBeta</code> and requires the user to set a seed to
reproduce results.
</p>
<p>The sensitivity/specificity values are allowed to vary across stages of
testing. For hierarchical testing, a different sensitivity/specificity value
may be used for each stage of testing. For array testing, a different
sensitivity/specificity value may be used for master pool testing (if
included), row/column testing, and individual testing. The values must be
specified in order of the testing performed. For example, values are
specified as (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3) for three-stage hierarchical
testing or (master pool testing, row/column testing, individual testing) for
array testing with master pooling. A single sensitivity/specificity value
may be specified instead. In this situation, sensitivity/specificity values
for all stages are assumed to be equal.
</p>
<p>The matrix specified  by <kbd>hier.config</kbd> defines the hierarchical group
testing algorithm for <code class="reqn">I</code> individuals. The rows of the matrix
correspond to the stages <code class="reqn">s=1,...,S</code> in the testing algorithm, and the
columns correspond to individuals <code class="reqn">i=1,...I</code>. The cell values within
the matrix represent the group number of individual <code class="reqn">i</code> at stage
<code class="reqn">s</code>. For three-stage, four-stage, and non-informative two-stage
hierarchical testing, the first row of the matrix consists of all ones.
This indicates that all individuals in the algorithm are tested together in
a single group in the first stage of testing. For informative two-stage
hierarchical testing, the initial group (block) is not tested. Thus, the
first row of the matrix consists of the group numbers for each individual
in the first stage of testing. For all hierarchical algorithms, the final
row of the matrix denotes individual testing. Individuals who are not tested
in a particular stage are represented by "NA" (e.g., an individual tested
in a group of size 1 in the second stage of testing would not be tested
again in a third stage of testing). It is important to note that this
matrix represents the testing that could be performed if each group tests
positively at each stage prior to the last. For more details on this matrix
(called a group membership matrix), see Bilder et al. (2019).
</p>
<p>For array testing without master pooling, the <kbd>rowcol.sz</kbd> specified
represents the row/column size for initial (stage 1) testing. For array
testing with master pooling, the <kbd>rowcol.sz</kbd> specified represents the
row/column size for stage 2 testing. This is because the master pool size
is the overall array size, given by the square of the row/column size.
</p>
<p>The displayed overall pooling sensitivity, pooling specificity, pooling
positive predictive value, and pooling negative predictive value are
weighted averages of the corresponding individual accuracy measures for all
individuals within the initial group (or block) for a hierarchical
algorithm, or within the entire array for an array-based algorithm.
Expressions for these averages are provided in the Supplementary
Material for Hitt et al. (2019). These expressions are based on accuracy
definitions given by Altman and Bland (1994a, 1994b).
</p>
<p>The <kbd>operatingCharacteristics1</kbd> function accepts additional arguments,
namely <kbd>num.sim</kbd>, to be passed to the <code>expectOrderBeta</code>
function, which generates a vector of probabilities for informative group
testing algorithms. The <kbd>num.sim</kbd> argument specifies the number of
simulations from the beta distribution when simulation is used. By default,
10,000 simulations are used.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function returns the pooling positive and negative
predictive values for all individuals even though these measures are
diagnostic specific; e.g., the pooling positive predictive value should
only be considered for those individuals who have tested positive.
</p>
<p>Additionally, only stage dependent sensitivity and specificity values are
allowed within the program (no group within stage dependent values are
allowed). See Bilder et al. (2019) for additional information.
