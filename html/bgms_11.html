<h2>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms of Wenchuan earthquake survivors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set containing items measuring symptoms of posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) (McNally et al. 2015). Participants were 362 
Chinese adults who survived the Wenchuan earthquake and lost at least one 
child in the disaster. PTSD symptoms were reported using the civilian version 
of the Posttraumatic Checklist, which consists of 17 items, each assessing 
one of the DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Participants rated each item on a 
five-point scale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely” to indicate how 
much the symptom bothered them in the past month.
