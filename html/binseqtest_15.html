<h2>Binary sequential tests</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Design and analyze binary sequential tests
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package creates designs for testing a series of
binary responses sequentially. It allows checking after
every response, or grouped sequential tests. Gives exact
confidence intervals and p-values. Has an option for
non-binding futility boundaries.
</p>
<p>There are functions for creating the binary sequential boundaries or binary grouped sequential boundaries  (see <code>designOBF</code>), 
creating tables of statistics (estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values) at 
specific stopping points in the boundary (see <code>link{stopTable}</code>), modifying the boundaries (see <code>modify</code>), 
and plotting the boundaries (<code>plot-methods</code>).
</p>
<p>For details see Kirk and Fay (2014).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># create an O'Brien-Fleming-type design, with 2.5 percent error on each side with max N of 50
B&lt;-designOBF(50)
# plot it
plot(B)
# create a table for N (total samples) values between 20 and 25
stopTable(B,Nrange=c(20,25))
# modify the boundary if you missed looks at N=30 through 35
Bmod&lt;-modify(B,missN=30:35)
plot(Bmod)
