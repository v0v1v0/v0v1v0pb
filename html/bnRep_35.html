<h2>bnRep: A Repository of Bayesian Network Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A repository of discrete, Gaussian, and conditional linear Gaussian Bayesian networks from the recent academic literature.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package includes over 200 Bayesian networks which appeared in recent academic papers. They can be accessed by their name, as provided in this documentation.
</p>
<p>They are stored as <code>bn.fit</code> objects from the <code>bnlearn</code> package. Recall that in order to plot them, the function <code>bn.net</code> must be used to convert them into a graph object.
</p>
<p>The package includes two handy functionalities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The <code>bnRep_summary</code> object: a dataframe including a lot of details about the Bayesian networks in the repository;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>bnRep_app</code> function, which launchs a Shiny app to explore the Bayesian networks in the repository.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the interface with <code>bnlearn</code>, functions from that package can be used to export the networks in other formats and use them in other platforms, such as Netica, Hugin, or Python.
