<h2> Data on Thickness of Stamps  </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Thickness in millimeters of 485 postal stamps, printed in 1872. The stamp 
issue of that year was thought to be a "philatelic mixture", 
that is, printed 
on more than one type of paper. It is of historical interest to determine
how many different types of paper were used.
