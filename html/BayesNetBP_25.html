<h2>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae eQTL data from Kruglak et. al. (2005)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>eQTL data from 112 F1 segregants from a cross between BY4716 and 
RM11-1a strains of <em>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</em>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(yeast)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data set <code>yeast</code> is a data frame of 112 observations of 50 variables: genotype 
data (genotype states at 12 SNP markers) and phenotype data (normalized and discretized 
expression values of 38 genes). Both genotypes and phenotypes are of class <code>factor</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>yeast</code> dataset is a subset of the widely studied yeast expression 
dataset comprising of 112 F1 segregants from a cross between BY4716 and RM11-1a 
strains of <em>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</em>. The original dataset consists of 
expression values reported as log2(sample/ BY reference) for 6216 genes. 
The data can be accessed in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) by accession number (GSE1990). 
After linkage analysis and filtering based on location and significance of QTL, 
a final set of 38 genes and their corresponding 12 SNP markers were identified and 
included in the yeast dataset. The gene expression values are discretized around 
the median and have two states, 1 (above or equal to median) and -1 (below median). 
re are two genotype states: 1 or 2. Thus the final dataset is a data frame of 112 observations 
(genotype) of 12 variables (SNP markers) and normalized gene expression of 38 variables (genes).
