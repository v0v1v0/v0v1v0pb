<h2> Calculates the lasker kinship coeffcient </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>“Lasker”calculates the lasker kinship coefficient starting from a surname frequency table.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lasker(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p> is a surname frequency table where the N rows correspond to the surnames present in the whole population and the M columns are the subpopulations </p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The use of “lasker” could be problematic, because different people are likely to arrange isonymy data in different ways on their computers. We decided for a matrix format for the isonymy data; the function would originally accept data in a different format and then convert it internally, but this would be a problem for people with data arranged in a different format. In the end we decided to write a specific function, "sur.freq", to generate surname frequency tables directly from raw marriage data or marriage-like data (the most commonly used sources in bio-demographic studies). For other types of surname data, see the verbose explanation in the info for the dataset "surnames" so it would be clear for the user how “lasker” works.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a square symmetric kinship matrix.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># starting from a raw marriage records dataset:
data(valley)
tot &lt;- sur.freq(valley,valley$PAR,valley$SURM,valley$SURF)
tot # a frequency table calculated above all the surnames
lask.kin &lt;- lasker(tot)
lask.kin # a kinship matrix

#starting from a generic surname frequency table
data(surnames)
surnames #a made-up dataset
# the surnames are arranged as the _rows_ and the populations are the _columns_
# the use of the function ``Lasker'' just turns this data into a kinship matrix
lask.kin &lt;- lasker(surnames)
lask.kin
