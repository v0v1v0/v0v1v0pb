<h2>
Disentangling the contributions of geographic and ecological isolation to genetic 
differentiation
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This method models the covariance in allele frequencies between populations on a 
landscape as a decreasing function of their pairwise geographic and ecological distance.  
Allele frequencies are modeled as a spatial Gaussian process with a parametric covariance 
function. The parameters of this covariance function, as well as the spatially smoothed 
allele frequencies, are estimated in a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo.
</p>
<p>The two inference functions are <code>MCMC</code> and <code>MCMC_BB</code>, which call the 
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms on the standard and overdispersion (Beta-Binomial)
models, respectively.  To evaluate MCMC performance, there are a number of MCMC diagnosis
and visualization functions, which variously show the trace, plots, marginal and joint
marginal densities, and parameter acceptance rates.  To evaluate model adequacy, there is 
a posterior predictive sample function (<code>posterior.predictive.sample</code>), and an
accompanying function to plot its output and visually assess the model's ability to 
describe the user's data.
