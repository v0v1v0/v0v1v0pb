<h2>Berry's functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Draw horizontal histograms, color scattered points by 3rd dimension, enhance date- and log-axis plots, zoom in X11 graphics, trace errors and warnings, use the unit hydrograph in a linear storage cascade, convert lists to data.frames and arrays, fit multiple functions.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Collection of functions, mainly connected with graphics and hydrology.<br>
- zoom in X11 graphics<br>
- plot rainfall-runoff data and optimize parameters for the unit hydrograph in the linear storage cascade<br>
- write text to plots on top of colored fields in label size (halo-effect)<br>
- draw scatterplots colored by 3rd dimension (as in image, which only deals with grids)<br>
- draw histograms horizontally<br>
- advancedly label date axes and logarithmic axes<br>
- fit multiple functions (power, reciprocal, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, rational) by regression<br>
- convert lists to data.frames<br>
- and more...
</p>
<p>At some places you'll find <code>## not run</code> in the examples. These code
blocks were excluded from checking while building, mainly because they are
interactive and need mouseclicks, or because they open another device/file.
Normally, you should be able to run them in an interactive session. If you
do find non-executable code, please tell me!<br>
Feel free to suggest packages in which these functions would fit well.<br>
I strongly depend on - and therefore welcome - any feedback!<br><br></p>
