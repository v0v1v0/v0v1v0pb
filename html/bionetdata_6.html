Functional Interaction Network data for human.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functional Interaction data obtained from the supplemental materials of a paper written by Wu and colleagues: 'A human functional protein interaction network and its application to cancer data analysis'. Data are represented through a binary named matrix and represent the presence or absence of gene-gene functional interactions. The original network is composed by more than 9000 genes. The network contained in the bionetdata R package is a reduced version containing 2033 nodes and obtained using the walktrap.community function of the R package igraphi. The walktrap.community function is an implementation of a community detection method developed by Pons and Latapy based on a between vertices similarity measure computed by means of a random walk.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(FIN.data)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Binary named matrix. Entry <code>FIN.data[i,j] = 1</code> if there is a functional interaction between gene i and j,
otherwise <code>FIN.data[i,j] = 0</code>.
