<h2>Simulated Noisy Records (smaller set)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing several files of noisy simulated records. Records are
simulated using GeCo (Tran, Vatsalan, and Cristen (2013)) and organized into
files of 10 records each. These files are subsets of the larger dataset.
The columns in each file consist of two ID columns for validating links:
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(geco_small)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of 7 data.frames. Each data.frame has 10 rows and 16 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> rec.id. Contains the entity number and duplicate number of each record. This is unique to a record.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> entity. Contains the entity number of which this record is a copy. Is identical for all records which are noisy duplicates of the same original.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The columns also consist of fields used to perform linkage, into which 3 errors
have been randomly inserted:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> given.name, surname. Text fields with potential typographical errors.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> age, occup, extra1, ..., extra10. Categorical fields with potential swapped category errors.
